No, they are not. They are the eDMA event numbers. I used the EDMA_CTRL_CHA=
N()
macro for all board files to have uniform look for the data. The first
parameter means the eDMA instance number while the second is the event numb=
er
on that eDMA. Since most devices have only one eDMA, we have 0 as eDMA id in
most cases.
The eventmux, or crossbar is different thing and we have several versions of
the event crossbar or mux used.

I see. The dm81xx basically am33xx/am43xx?

Actually I would prefer to use the dmaengine's event router framework and we
do have support for the am33xx/am43xx type of crossbar already implemented.
I'm going to resend the DTS series for am33xx/am43xx to convert them to use
the new DT bindings along with the dma event router support:

In theory it can be done, but in practice it is not possible. It is up to t=
he
board design decision to select which DMA event is not needed to be used in
default mode and that one can be used to route the crossbar hidden request =
to it.
Just imaging: playing audio from MMC (in the example you have), audio needs
constant DMA, so the MMC would never get DMA request, also the drivers tend=
 to
request the DMA channel in their probe/init and hold to it as long as they =
are
loaded...

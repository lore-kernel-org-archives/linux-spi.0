That's just a statement that it's possible to do things this way, it's
not clear to me that it's an explanation as to why it is sensible to do
so - the obvious thing to do there would be to specify the flash
operation as a flash operation rather than reverse engineer the flash
operation from the wire format.

If this stuff doesn't appear in the spi_message in some observable form
then I'd expect that any existing flash support is broken since a SPI
controller that doesn't have any acceleration is just going to do what
the message says.

Which comes back to the thing I keep saying about needing some sort of
information about what the flag means and the questions about why this
is a good interface...

There's an awful lot of flashes out there connected to controllers that
don't implement any sort of acceleration for flash, I'm not convinced
that your assumption there is valid.

We definitely need to account for that.

Absolutely not. The "necessary stuff" includes arch-specific things
which would require filling the SPI code with arch-specific #ifdefs, and
may go as far as private data structures held by other drivers (e.g.
IOMMUs) which the SPI code cannot even touch, let alone know what to do
with. The "parent device" here *is* the real DMA master device (as
described by firmware and configured by the arch code accordingly), so
using any other device for DMA is just plain wrong.

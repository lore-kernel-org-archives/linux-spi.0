I think Mark is the prominent figure that this would interest.

I've taken a look at Huang's framework and it doesn't provide us with
anything extra to what the m25p80 would provide. We did have the idea
of splitting our driver into two distinct areas; the MTD part, which
we planned on using the m25p80 for and an SPI Controller portion.

However, as we send entire 'message sequences' to the FSM Controller
as opposed to merely OPCODEs we would have to extract the OPCODE from
flash->command[0] and call our own functions to craft the correct
'message sequence' for the task. For this reason we rejected the idea
and went with a stand-alone driver.

The framework which Huang is proposing suffers from the same issues.
Only providing read(), write(), read_reg() and write_reg() doesn't
work for our use-case, as we'd have to decode the flash->command[0] and
invoke our own internal routines as before.

The only framework with would work for us would consist almost all
of the important functions such as; read(), write(), erase(),
wait_busy(), read_jedec(), read_status_reg(), write_status_reg(),
read_control_reg(), write_control_reg(), etc. However, this approach
is mostly pointless. We'd be better of just using the MTD Framework's
_read, _write and _erase call-backs as we do now.

=46or these reasons and a bunch of others I think the best solution for
our particular use-case would be to stick with our stand-alone driver
implementation.

Yes of course, no problem.

In September I've sent a series of patches to enhance the support of QS=
PI flash
memories. Patch 4 was dedicated to the m25p80 driver and set the
rx_nbits / tx_nbits fields of spi_transfer struct(s) in order to config=
ure the
number of I/O lines independently for the opcode, address and data part=
s.
The work was done for m25p80_read() but also for _read_reg(), _write_re=
g() and
_write().
The patched m25p80 driver was then tested with an at25 memory to check =
non-
regression.

This series of patches also added 4 enum spi_protocol fields inside str=
uct
spi_nor so the spi-nor framework can tell the (Q)SPI controller driver =
what SPI
protocol should be use for erase, read, write and register read/write
operations, depending on the memory manufacturer and the command opcode=
=2E
This was done to better support Micron, Spansion and Macronix QSPI memo=
ries.

I have tested the series with Micron QSPI memories and Atmel QSPI contr=
oller
and I guess Marek also tested it on his side with Spansion QSPI memorie=
s and
another QSPI controller.

So if it can help other developers to develop QSPI controller drivers, =
the
series is still available there:

for the whole series:

1170.html

for patch 4 (depends on patch 2 for enum spi_protocol):

1173.html

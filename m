Hi Mokuno,

Thanks for the thorough review and good comments!
Some of your comments are answered inline, others will be addressed in future
 patch submission.

I would give v6 of this patch more time to be reviewed by community, so that
more comments can come and I can handle them altogether.

Thanks,
Feng

A little strange, I'm using checkpatch.pl in kernel source, which doesn't
generate any warning. Which version are you using?

Reading Max3110 buffer is asynchronous operation, like for the reader thread,
spi controller will write 8 words of 0 to max3110, and read 8 words back, the
first word doesn't have a valid data doesn't mean the following don't, and we
need to check them all

Andrew mentioned a race condition for using set/test_bit for mthread_up
flag, which I don't quiet follow due to my lack of SMP race experience,
mthread_up is not designed to make some code exclusive. And whether the main
thread can be woken up to run depends on the max->flags setting.

You mean 
	if (use_irq && test_and_clear_bit(..))
		max3110_con_receive(max);
?

Yes, it's better. I put clear_bit() after max3110_con_receive() because
I test that bit to decide whether we need wakeup the main thread again
in the ISR in old version submission.

Yep, good catch here, if there is RX data in buffer, the IRQ pin will
be asserted low always. But the IRQ line will usually be connected to
system through a GPIO pin, we use falling edge for GPIO pin IRQ trigger,
when 3110's IRQ is asserted, that GPIO pin will be changed from high to low,
the ISR and following handler will try to read all the RX data out to
make 3110's IRQ go back to high, waiting for another IRQ.

Nice trick, but it may confuse readers without any explanation :)

If you check the Figure 1 of the data sheet, there is still a TX buffer
there tough only one word :) or should I change it to 1?

If using global struct, the space will be allocated no matter the system
really have a Max3110, putting the allocation in probe() is flexible

Well I am not sure it is related to CHCONF[6] EPOL bit. During exchange 
on SPI, CS is in the good state. But when system wake up from an 
off-mode, CS is in its active state (high state for our configuration). 
I thought it was more a problem with CHCONF[20] FORCE bit, indeed this 
bit is at 0, so CS should be in low state. It is only when we first set 
this bit to 1 and then to 0, that CS go to low state.
It sounds like an hardware bug on this bit, or let's say an undocumented 
feature ;)
CS stay in high state until the next transaction on the SPI bus, indeed 
as the driver use CHCONF[20] FORCE bit during exchange, it will do the 
transition on this bit. That's why nobody noticed it until now, because 
from the software point of view it works.

I didn't test it with CHCONF[6] EPOL bit set to 1.

Our silicon revision was OMAP3530-GP ES3.1.

The patch

   spi: Add DMA support for spi_flash_read()

has been applied to the spi tree at

   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/spi.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] spi: Add DMA support for spi_flash_read()

Few SPI devices provide accelerated read interfaces to read from
SPI-NOR flash devices. These hardwares also support DMA to transfer data
from flash to memory either via mem-to-mem DMA or dedicated slave DMA
channels. Hence, add support for DMA in order to improve throughput and
reduce CPU load.
Use spi_map_buf() to get sg table for the buffer and pass it to SPI
driver.

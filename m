Oh dear. :(

What a pickle.  As per my last email, it looks as though this set was
applied under false pretences.  The MFD patch which was carrying my
Ack was doing so incorrectly.  The author mistakenly applied it to the
wrong patch.  After re-review (actually initial review) I wish to NACK
the implementation.

My suggestion would be to sit tight, rather than do anything rash and
see how this plays out.  After which we can fix your tree.

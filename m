The issue is that: "The device tree is a data structure for describing =
hardware"
DMA_MIN_BYTES is a software parameter. To be specific, it is Linux soft=
ware
parameter applicable only to spi-omap2-mcspi.c driver.

I think the best thing we could do is to calculate the DMA_MIN_BYTES in=
 the
driver based on the SPI speed. Something which will give ~160 in the sp=
eed in
which the wl driver is used and something which works best in your setu=
p in
the speed you are using the SPI bus.
The best way is to give some msec as a limit. If the transfer would tak=
e more
then X msec on the bus to be transferred, we will use DMA, if it is les=
s than
that we fall back to PIO.
Yes, the CPU speed is not taken into account, but IMHO the bus speed is=
 more
important.

What do you think? Will this work for you?

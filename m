This looks interesting.
But there's a challenge with the uart1 and the 8250 driver.

Phil Elwell has this to say:
This means that that UART1 isn't an exact clone of a 8250 UART.
In a particular, the clock divisor is calculated differently.
A standard 8250 derives the baud rate as clock/(divisor16),
whereas the BCM2835 mini UART uses clock/(divisor8). This means
that if you want to use the standard driver then you need to lie
about the clock frequency, providing a value is twice the real
value, in order for a suitable divisor to be calculated.

So either we need a new uart1 driver or a doubled clock freq. somehow.

This occurred to me as well. Another possibility, though, would be to 
leave it up to the client device drivers to support both cases, e.g.:

	if (master has SPI_CS_WORD support)
		setup message as single transfer
	else
		setup message as multiple one-word transfers

This seems like that would be more efficient than having a generic 
implementation for masters that says:

	if (master does not have SPI_CS_WORD support)
		allocate enough transfers for each word of each
			each transfer of the message
		allocate and setup a new message for these transfers
		loop through the original transfers of the original
			message and copy them to the new transfers
		send the new message
		free allocated message and transfers

There is already a generic mode flags check in spi_setup() that will 
catch this and return an error if the device has the SPI_CS_WORD flag 
set and the controller does not. (I know this works because I ran into 
it during development.)

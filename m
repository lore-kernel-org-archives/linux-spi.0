This patch series integrates Renesas RSPI on the RZ/A1H aka R7S72100 SoC,
and the Genmai development board.

The series is based on renesas-devel-v3.13-rc5-20131226, with Magnus'
pinctrl, Wolfram's riic, and Simon's sh_eth work applied on top.

It was tested on the Genmai development board (genmai-reference), using
an in-kernel version of Documentation/spi/spidev_test.c, exercising
loopback mode on rspi1, with the same outcome as the SDK reference code.

Notes:
  1. The proposed DT bindings also talk about QSPI on the R8A779x, as those
     SoCs use the same driver.
  2. As the actual spi-rspi driver doesn't use DT yet, platform devices and
     spi board info are still used from C to instantiate SPI buses and their
     children, while pinctrl is performed by DT.
  3. It will not work with the non-reference version of genmai, due to
     missing pinmux configuration in setup-r7s72100.c.
  4. Patches [4/8] and [5/8] are new.

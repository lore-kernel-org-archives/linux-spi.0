The patch

   spi: omap2-mcspi: Fix modifying platform resource data

has been applied to the spi tree at

   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/spi.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] spi: omap2-mcspi: Fix modifying platform resource data

currently during probe the resource data gets modified and device
physical address remains valid only during first load. If the module is
unloaded and loaded again, the ioremp will be done on a incorrect address
as the resource was modified during previous module load.
This patch fixes this issue.

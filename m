There are at least one place in the UBIFS layer where a small buffer is vmalloc'ed:

static int read_ltab(struct ubifs_info *c)
{
    int err;
    void *buf;

    buf = vmalloc(c->ltab_sz);
    if (!buf)
        return -ENOMEM;
    err = ubifs_leb_read(c, c->ltab_lnum, buf, c->ltab_offs, c->ltab_sz, 1);
    if (err)
        goto out;
    err = unpack_ltab(c, buf);
out:
    vfree(buf);
    return err;
}

On my board, the buffer size is 11 bytes.

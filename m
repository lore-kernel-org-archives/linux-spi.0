Ok.

Do you think that we can go forward with this patch series if I drop the last
patch (spi/ep93xx: add DMA support)? This way we will have dmaengine
implementation in place, whatever SPI driver we choose to use with ep93xx.

We can then try to use amba-pl022 driver with ep93xx and see if it works or
not, and how much work is needed. I would like some comments from Hartley and
Ryan also.

Check for example Technologic Systems (embeddedarm.com), I have their TS-7260
board which has ep9302.

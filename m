There is no difference, the PCI DMA alias code is meant to handle any
case where the requester ID of a DMA is different from the device that
actually initiates the DMA.  That may be a different function on a MFD,
it may be a non-existent devfn, or it may be an upstream device.  Note
that using function 0 as the DMA controller for other functions of a MFD
is a broken design in a world of IOMMUs.  It means that we cannot
distinguish transactions from different functions and we need to
pre-enable these aliases for the device to work correctly.  There's
nothing in the PCIe spec that allows an MFD to use the wrong requester
ID for DMA.

It's in the process of being removed https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/5/22/725

I'm not sure how you'll incorporate it, but creating a
pci_get_dma_device() helper which assumes a specific broken relationship
for DMA is clearly not a supportable solution.  Thanks,

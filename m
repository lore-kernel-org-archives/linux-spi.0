    It's not a DMA controller only, it's 3 distinct devices, with the DMA 
controller being one among them and using another one, the queue manager, as 
some sort of proxy. The third device doesn't exist on OMAP-L1x SoCs -- it's 
the buffer manager.

    Sorry, now it's TI's task. I no longer have time to work on this (my 
internal project to push OMAP-L1x support upstream has expired at Sep 2010) 
and my future in MV is very uncertain at this moment. Most probably I'll leave 
it (or be forced to leave).

    Could have been the same with CPPI 4.1 in theory if it was added to 
mach-davinci/ back in 2009... we'd then only have to move it. EDMA code is 
much older of course, so it's probably more justified.

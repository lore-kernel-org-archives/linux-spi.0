Some systems (e.g. Android, Brillo) do not ship acpidump and in this
case the only way to dump tables is by accessing sysfs directly.

I guess the perf model where you have a perf package build together
with the kernel will work. But right now distributions are not using
this model and a kernel change will break the userspace tool.

That will still break if you upgrade the kernel and use the old tool.

To me this still looks like breaking userspace, patches have been
reverted for less :) But I can see how this could be considered a gray
area.

ABI aside, see below for why configfs is better then sysfs.

It is hard to create new kernel objects from sysfs. You need to resort
to hacks like using new_table sysfs entries which does not map to a
kernel object. Writes larger then PAGE_SIZE are impossible to handle
with multiple open files because you have no open callback to create a
file context. It is also not possible to do any clean-up because there
is no close callback and if something goes wrong for example when
trying to install the table you will leak the allocated memory.

configfs was designed for the specific purpose of creating kernel
objects from userspace and addresses all of the limitations above (and
some more).

Initially I started to implement this functionality via sysfs but I
run into the issues mentioned above and decided to use configfs.

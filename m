You're right, there is no point generalizing stuff that is truly SoC
specific.  I'm interested in identifying the bits and techniques that
are useful to other SoCs and architectures.

I'm happy to maintain any infrastructure if need be.

Yes, I agree.

Well for an example, we've talked a lot about the platform_bus_type.
Associativity between devices (parent/child) is a core part of the
Linux device model, and it is a common problem to know what the device
topology is for handing init and PM ordering.  I'd like to know what
topology you need to describe for the OMAP SoCs.  Does the Linux
driver model topology provide any of the information you need, or does
OMAP HWMOD implement its own topology infrastructure?  What is missing
from the driver model that requires a lookaside to HWMOD to obtain the
SoC topology?

I'm certainly not arguing that all SoC specific infrastructure needs
to be generalized.  Rather I want to find common features and
techniques that can be used by SoC specific code.

Of course it does; it's only a data structure!  :-D  It can encode
data about the hardware; but it cannot describe operating system
behaviour.

At the very least, the structure of the SoC probably needs to be
reflected in the device tree.  A lot of the time nodes for internal
SoC devices end up becoming 'handles' to describe attachments to
external hardware.  ie. i2c device nodes hanging off an SoC i2c
controller, or interrupt connections.  Since those nodes have to be
there anyway, it is useful (and less confusing) to have them reflect
the actual internal structure of the SoC.

>From my brief look, it appears that omap_hwmod consists of two parts;
a set of data structures and code that define the behaviour of the
kernel, and the per-SoC data that populates the tables.  There is no
doubt that the structure definitions and support code are part of the
kernel.  They are kernel implementation details.

The data could either be kept in the kernel, or be populated from the
device tree.  My *preference* is certainly to encode data about the
SoC into the device tree, mostly because I've seen it as valuable on
the other SoCs I've worked on (it is convenient to have all the data
in one place, and it results in high associativity between related
information.  ie. don't need to do use odd methods like
spi_register_board_info() to associate devices with the bus they are
attached to).

However, it doesn't have to be implement that way so long as there is
a method to reliably associate device tree nodes with data already
encoded into the kernel.

anyway...

What I'm thinking about doing at the embedded microconf is asking a
few people (you included) to speak briefly about what they are doing
to describe their platforms, and see if any common functionality
bubbles to the top.  I think it is to easy to get focused on our own
problem domain and miss that others are working on very similar
problems in isolation.

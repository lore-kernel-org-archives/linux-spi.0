So a soft-spi ? It's gonna be slow as hell and unstable too.

Get a CPU which has SPI-slave capable IP, start from there. If you were to 
implement soft-spi this way, you'd have to use FIQ on ARM, to be able to handle 
stuff with reasonable latency ... check how the ps/2-gpio driver is done in 
Linux ... I tried it, it barely worked, you don't want to go down that road.

Not happening. You'd have to split the parts from the struct spi_master into 
common and master-only parts. That's for starters.

First of all, the SPI slave mode is COMPLETELY different from the master mode. 
You need to react on incoming CS-low ASAP, which might turn out to be a problem 
on it's own. Then, even if you do, you do not know how long the transfer is 
going to be, so you need to allocate enough buffers as the transfer progresses 
onwards.

In case of your soft-spi, how do you plan to sample the CLK line to sync clock?

This was tested (and developed) on this board:
http://www.denx-cs.de/?q=M28

The userland code is really easy too, simply pump it into spidev or read from 
it. But all that is only possible because of the SPI IP in the mx28 is nice.

It is a Quad SPI controller. SPI NOR flash devices are the most common
interface. But we hope to keep this driver generic.
The above function name is probably misleading; it can be renamed.

This SPI controller has two CS lines and two data bus.
Two devices can be connected to these and either the upper or the
lower or both (Explained below) can be selected.

When two flash devices are used, one of the HW configurations in
which they can be connected is called "parallel" mode where they
share the same CS but use separate 4 bit data bus each
(essentially making it 8 bit bus width).
Another configuration is "stacked" mode where the
same 4 bit data bus is shared and lower or upper CS lines are
used to select the flash.

Nevertheless, we will deal with acceptable ways to add such features
incrementally or maybe send an RFC separately.
For the current patch (which is intended to support a single device),
the above selection of "both" CS wont be necessary.
@Ranjit, please remove it.

This is the only way to assert the CS. It doesn't start transferring any data.
The controller has a Generic FIFO. All operations to be performed on the
bus have to be given in the form of any entry in this FIFO.
The controller fetches each entry from the FIFO and performs the operations.
And that includes asserting and de-asserting CS. There is no dedicated
register bit to assert or de-assert the CS.

The GEN FIFO entry has fields such as:
- TX or RX
- CS - lower/upper
- data bus - lower/upper
- bytecount
- bus width - x1 or x2 or x4
etc.

@Ranjit It might be useful to describe the GENFIFO format in
the driver at some appropriate place.

Harini

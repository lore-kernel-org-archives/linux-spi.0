never seen such a behavior. Which platform are you using? Which SPI
driver? Do you have a low level printk (printascii) that puts output
somewhere else so I can send you a patch with some debugging output?
Can you log in some other way (like via network) and see if the CPU
load is at 100% for some reason?

no, I put RTS on  because it looks like a good default. I can make it
configurable. I just noticed on the data sheet that RTS is actually
inverted so a more sensible default would be to put it off. For
testing you should have flow control set to none on the machine you
are using as a terminal emulator.

yes but I think it's quite difficult to solve this problem in every
case. Console output is massively used only on boot when the user is
not supposed to type a lot.

Have you configured your SPI controller as LSB first somehow, haven't
you? BTW my platform is a quite usual ARM9 S3C2440 which is little
endian.

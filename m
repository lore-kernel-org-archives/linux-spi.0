The messages are sensible interface for communicating with a device
that interprets a particular part of the mesasge as address and
another particular part of the message as command and sends same
amount of junk before reply as the flash chip would. If your device
happens to send reply immediately part of it is trashed. If it happens
to interpret address differently the data ends up in random part of
your memory. So no, that is not something you can autodetect.

At the end of the day you have valid SPI messages but the m25p80 layer
adds interpretation to those messages which may not always give
correct result.

On the other hand, if you ever get to m25p80 or spi-nor you can assume
any message you send goes to a flash chip and insist that the
controller uses the flash-specific interface.

If there is possibility of connecting different kind of devices to
multiple chipselects on the same master then you probably want to
select this option per message or per slave.

Thanks

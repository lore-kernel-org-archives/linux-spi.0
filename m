True. For instance, Atmel SAMA5* SoCs don't need this bounce buffer
since their L1 data cache uses a PIPT scheme.

http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=3D/com.arm.doc.ddi0433c/CHDF=
AHBD.html

"""
2.1.4. Data side memory system

Data Cache Unit

The Data Cache Unit (DCU) consists of the following sub-blocks:

    The Level 1 (L1) data cache controller, which generates the control
signals for the associated embedded tag, data, and dirty memory (RAMs)
and arbitrates between the different sources requesting access to the
memory resources. The data cache is 4-way set associative and uses a
Physically Indexed Physically Tagged (PIPT) scheme for lookup which
enables unambiguous address management in the system.
"""

So for those SoCs, spi_map_msg() should be safe to handle vmalloc'ed
buffers since they don't have to worry about the cache aliases issue or
address truncation.

That's why I don't think setting the SNOR_F_USE_BOUNCE_BUFFER in *all*
cases in m25p80 is the right solution since it would not fair to degrade
the performances of some devices when it's not needed hence not justified.

I still agree with the idea of patch 1 but about patch 2, if m25p80
users want to take advantage of this new spi-nor bounce buffer, we have
to agree on a reliable mechanism that clearly tells whether or not the
SNOR_F_USE_BOUNCE_BUFFER is to be set from m25p80.

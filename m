Yes, I need to change this. should be readb.

same here.

Yes, I will change this in the next version.

But I see in this documentation, that setup is usually used for setting up
device clock rate, modes etc.
So, what do you recommend here, should we move clk settings to prepare
hardware ?

hmm. Ok, will add.

Actually, it is no different. This also means the total number of 
chipselects.
I used it from omap mcspi. I will make this property in accordance with the
generic binding.
Will also send a seperate patch for omap mcspi.

hmm.will change.

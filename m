So it appears that I have broken the native chip select support.

I have a serial flash at spi0cs0 and if I use the GPIO for chip select
it detects:
m25p80 spi1.0: n25q128a13 (16384 Kbytes)

If I use the native chip select it does not:
m25p80 spi1.0: unrecognized JEDEC id bytes: ff, ff, ff

This allows me to find the issue and provide a follow up patch.
I will provide it when I have it ready to see if it fixes your issue.

If I cannot find a fix, we may have to revert these changes.

Agree. I haven't commented on the latest MBUS patches yet. Meanwhile i
am trying to get a better understanding of the hardware. In general if
there are no better suggestions, i am fine with adding a specific name
to handle this kind of dma transfers.

Yes, cpu-qup should be for register access. Alok, please correct me if i
am wrong, but I believe this is a separate bus used only for
configuration access to some HW blocks. This bus might be disabled by
default and we may need to request some bandwidth in order to enable it.
It's described as a separate path in DT and we are trying to give it a
meaningful name.

Thanks,
Georgi

Please follow the guidelines in Documentation/SubmittingPatches. Patche=
s as
attachments are not preferred since it makes replying/commenting on the
patches hard.

Strictly speaking the dma-min-bytes should not be in DT, it is a softwa=
re
parameter for the Linux SPI driver implementation.
Also, when changing DT bindings, please update the documentation as wel=
l (and
CC the relevant lists with that).

This threshold of 160 bytes in the omap2-mcspi driver is artificial any=
ways it
is changed from 8 to 160 by this commit:
8b66c13474e16 spi/omap2_mcspi: change default DMA_MIN_BYTES value to 16=
0

It has been changed because of wl1271, but I'm not sure if banging byte=
s over
the bus when the transfer is less then 160bytes is that great thing. I =
would
guess that the sweet spot is at around the low tens.

But if it is really like this that different devices perform better wit=
h
different threshold for choosing between PIO or DMA transfer then this =
setting
should come from the slave device and should only affect the transfer s=
etup
when communicating with that device.

Probably adding a parameter (optional) to spi_device struct, so drivers=
 can
pass dma_over_poi_threshold?
If it is not set, than just use whatever is the default.

But I don't think this setting should be in the DT.

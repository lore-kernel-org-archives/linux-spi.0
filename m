The patch

   spi: dw: Correct handling of native chipselect

has been applied to the spi tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/spi.git for-5.5

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] spi: dw: Correct handling of native chipselect

This patch reverts commit 6e0a32d6f376 ("spi: dw: Fix default polarity
of native chipselect").

The SPI framework always called the set_cs callback with the logic
level it desired on the chip select line, which is what the drivers
original handling supported. commit f3186dd87669 ("spi: Optionally
use GPIO descriptors for CS GPIOs") changed these symantics, but only
in the case of drivers that also support GPIO chip selects, to true
meaning apply slave select rather than logic high. This left things in
an odd state where a driver that only supports hardware chip selects,
the core would handle polarity but if the driver supported GPIOs as
well the driver should handle polarity.  At this point the reverted
change was applied to change the logic in the driver to match new
system.

This was then broken by commit 3e5ec1db8bfe ("spi: Fix SPI_CS_HIGH
setting when using native and GPIO CS") which reverted the core back
to consistently calling set_cs with a logic level.

This fix reverts the driver code back to its original state to match
the current core code. This is probably a better fix as a) the set_cs
callback is always called with consistent symantics and b) the
inversion for SPI_CS_HIGH can be handled in the core and doesn't need
to be coded in each driver supporting it.

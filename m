OK, will try to remember and improve things in future.

I had it done in the driver core in first versions of this patch, but
then I learnt it is not something Greg would be fond of, so I went for
this method. In fact, clocks configuration is not something which
applies to each and every device, thus putting it in the bus code might
not be that bad after all.

The flag is there to tell if clocks supplied by a particular device should
also be configured. The function is being called with the flag set right
after a clock provider registration in the clock core, this is where the
take care of things when an (I2C, SPI, etc.) device is a clock provider.
Obviously attempting to configure clocks which were not yet registered
before a device's driver probe() call would fail. The flag is there to
defer configuration of clocks after they are actually registered with
the clk core, not only parsable from the device tree.

Documentation of the function might be indeed a bit confusing :/
I'll consider changing the sentence:

"The @clk_supplier argument
 should be set to true if @node may be also a clock supplier of any clock
 listed in its 'assigned-clocks' or 'assigned-clock-parents' properties."

to

 "The @clk_supplier argument
  should be set to true if @node is or may be a clock supplier of any
  clock listed in its 'assigned-clocks' or 'assigned-clock-parents'
  properties and such clocks are also to be configured."

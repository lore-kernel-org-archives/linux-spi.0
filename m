Issuing WREN is needed for certain sequences of operations.  I guess your
question relates to why have I included it as part of the 'spi_nor_xfer_cfg'
structure, when it could be controlled from the spi_nor layer with a separate
spi_nor_xfer.

Well, firstly, I am aware of at least one H/W controller that can be optimised
to issue the WREN command as part of a longer erase or write sequence, thereby
avoiding the overheads of issuing a separate spi_nor_xfer.

However, the main reason was to try and come up with a generic representation
for a typical Serial Flash transfer, capturing, where possible, the semantics of
the intended operation, just in case that information can be used by the
underlying H/W in some way.  In this instance, the WREN cycles just represents
another part of the transfer, in the same way as the command, address, mode, and
dummy cycles.

The aim of the 'spi_nor_xfer_cfg' is to provide an interface between the spi-nor
layer and the underlying H/W driver.   In some cases, the H/W may need to know
the address width (e.g. issuing a new command sequence, with an incremented
address, following an arbitration stall).  You could argue that the H/W driver
should be able query the spi_nor structure, or perhaps store the addr_width
field during an initialisation process, but I feel having it as part of the
'spi_nor_xfer_cfg' provides a cleaner interface between the two layers.

The default implementation would do just as you suggest, and I would expect most
H/W drivers to use the default implementation.  However, some H/W Controllers
can automate the polling of status registers, so having a hook allows the driver
override the default behaviour.

Serial Flash devices support various "Erase Sector" commands, and an "Erase
Chip" command.  The erase_sector() and erase_chip() hooks would just form the
appropriate command sequences (e.g. Erase Chip does not require address cycles).

I have to admit, the circumstances that provoke an erase_chip() are rather
limited.  As far as I can see, the MTD tool 'mtd_debug' is the only component
that can lead to an Erase Chip operation, and even then, only when the device is
not partitioned.  However, m25p80 supports Erase Chip, so I thought I would
maintain that support here.

As I said before, my proposal was just some initial ramblings of my mind, and I
am definitely open to discussion and other suggestions.

To be honest, I am just glad that someone is taking a look at this area.
However, whether or not is it possible to come up with something that solves all
our problems remains to be seen.  It might turn out that the various H/W
Controllers are just too different to fit into a single unified framework.

Cheers,

Angus

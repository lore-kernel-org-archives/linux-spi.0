Thanks for your review.

I use scripts/get_maintainer.pl on the patches and keep all maintainers.
I'll further refine the list in the future.

I will implement set_cs() and transfer_one() instead in next patch.

Could you tell me more details about "You should also be using the core
helpers for DMA mapping"?

MT6589 and MT8135 is compatible; 
For MT8135 IC, it can use the follow way in dts to probe:
  compatible = "mediatek,mt8135-spi", 
	       "mediatek,mt6589-spi";
And I test it's ok on MT8135 platform. So I add struct of_device_id
mtk_spi_of_match like this in spi driver code.

In the case of other review comments, I will also fix them in next/OK.

There is always data. Like in whenever you want to read SPI data you
sample the input pin and watever you sample is data so far as SPI bus
is concerned.

Could check that, yes. Maybe I could read the counter in a function
which dmaengine client uses to tear down the dma transfer.

On a related note I enabled more prints on the spidev test program.

I have code that tests maximum transfer size up to the 4k spidev limit
and it can transfer full 4k buffer of NOPs at 80MHz.

The recieved data is all ones except a 00 at the start. So it looks
like read-only transfers fail but full-duplex sort of work. And it
reproduces the 00 prefix that was seen in the dma-only setup in
otherwise working setup :-S

An attempt to read a page of data using the fast-read command fails
with timeout.

No. The DMA  driver has no idea if the transfer is at 133MHz, 40MHz,
1MHz, 1kHz, whatever.

On the other hand, adding a flush_fifo in the SPI driver after DMA
failure allows probing the chip reliably by realoding the driver even
just after a failed transfer.

The suspicious function is enable_datapath in the s3c64xx driver.
There is even a comment about keeping the clock going on half-duplex
transfers.

I did not get to dissecting it so far.

Thanks

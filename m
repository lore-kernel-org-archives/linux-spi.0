Yeah, but then the bounces are going to slow things down anyway.  This
does seem fixable if we do something with caching the buffer once we
create it, and if it's implemented elsewhere the same problem will
exist.  We can't just allocate the maximum possible buffer size because
some devices have effectively unlimited transfer sizes so you could
waste huge amounts of memory, especially in the common case where we
don't use vmalloc() at all.

I'm not so worried about that, the numbers are basically an educated
guess anyway.  It's a concern though, yes.

Anything that doesn't support chaining is in trouble already (or should
be soon hopefully), but mostly the controllers will have no idea about
that as they're just asking their DMA controller to do things.  We'd be
better off having the core query the capabilities of the DMA controllers
directly.

I think the idea was to ensure you only use one mapping type at once.

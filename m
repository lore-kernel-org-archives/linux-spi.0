All:

we plan resume this work.
I need direction how go ahead further.

I go through this email thread.

The discussion focus on how to get dummy cycle information.

Shijie get it from DT.

Brain suggest get from CFI or map id table if I understand correct.

Accodring to spec
http://www.spansion.com/Support/Datasheets/S25FL128S_256S_00.pdf

Table 8.10

Dummy cycle depend on frequency, read command.

if information saved in driver, it will be huge table.

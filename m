It is not the case, at least it is not what we
observed. In suspend state, CS is inactive.

As far as I know, it enter correctly that OFF mode.
It is only at wake up, that CS become active while
there is no SPI message being processed. It is the
point of my patch.

My first patch version forced unconditionally CS to
inactive state at wake up. It was correct from the
point of view of the SPI but not for suspend/resume.
Resume should only restore the state of the driver
just before suspend. If resume force the inactive
state it could mask a bug in the suspend path.
But as I wrote before, as far as I know there is no
bug when driver enter suspend mode, at this moment
CS is inactive.

I agree and this driver seems to respect this point.

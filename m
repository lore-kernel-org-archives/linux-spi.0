This patch extends the DMA engine with a PrimeCell superset with
three functions: configure DMA channel, stop channel, and one for
getting the number of bytes pending on a channel. These have been
identified as the basic extensions needed to drive DMA on top of
the PL011, PL022 and PL180 PrimeCells.

Changes since last version:
- Two functions were moved into the DMA engine API instead

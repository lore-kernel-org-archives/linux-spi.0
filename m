Are you seeing actual problem here or adding loop just in case? Is it 
really so that PCI bridge doesn't generate another MSI interrupt if SPI 
controller has interrupt pending when handler returns? I don't know but 
I would expect irq line between SPI controller and PCI bridge is still 
level sensitive even PCI bridge issues MSIs to the CPU.

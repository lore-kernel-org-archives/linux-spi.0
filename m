Move the platform data parts to include/linux/platform_data.
Move the driver specific parts to be either in the .c file for the
driver, or in a .h file _along_ _side_ the .c file.

Private data for drivers should be kept as close to the driver as
possible, whether that be in the same .c file as the driver itself,
or a header co-located with the .c file.

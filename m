Changing DMA_MIN_BYTES to, say, "dma_min_time_ms" sounds reasonable to
me. I don't know how to compute it completely accurately as some SPI
implementations I've seen seem to like to inject little delays between
bytes for some reason, but a reasonable enough estimate should just be
spi_transfer_time_ms = (bits * 1000) / spi_clock_speed.

I would like to have the ability to configure it without a kernel
recompile, though. Would a kernel param (module_param) be acceptable for
this application?

You don't happen to know the WL12xx SPI clock speed off the top of your
head, do you?

Regards,
Greg

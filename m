yes, sorry, I have to admit that didn't explain myself properly,
but code speaks better than words.

What I meant is that if we do not like num-cs = <0>, the
unlinked CS line can be handled only this way (case of the
s3c64xx driver):

Which is not something I like, because it means adding a new
flag in the dts.

What I want to suggest, instead, is to slightly change the logic
behind the num-cs property: i.e. if "num-cs = <0>", doesn't
necessarily mean that we don't have a CS controller, but, while
we can have as many as we wish, non of them is connected.

Looking around in the spi drivers, apparently I am not the only
one who has this need, as I pointed out in my previous mail.

Thanks a lot,
Andi

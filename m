I will work on a patch series implementing bounce buffer support in SPI
core and extend ->can_dma() to inform when bounce buffer needs to be
used. This will make sure that SPI controller drivers that are not
affected by cache aliasing problem or LPAE buffers don't have
performance impact. Any comments appreciated!

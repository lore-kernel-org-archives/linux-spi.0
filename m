The patch

   spi: export tracepoint symbols to modules

has been applied to the spi tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/spi.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] spi: export tracepoint symbols to modules

The newly added tracepoints in the spi-mxs driver cause a link
error when the driver is a loadable module:

ERROR: "__tracepoint_spi_transfer_stop" [drivers/spi/spi-mxs.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "__tracepoint_spi_transfer_start" [drivers/spi/spi-mxs.ko] undefined!

I'm not quite sure where to put the export statements, but
directly after the inclusion of the header seems as good as
any other place.

Fixes: f3fdea3af405 ("spi: mxs: add tracing to custom .transfer_one_message callback")

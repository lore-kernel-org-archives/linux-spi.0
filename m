Sure, but I also think Huang is coming close to the new framework. Have you seen 
his latest patchset ( Message-ID: <1386318764-15882-1-git-send-email-
b32955-KZfg59tc24xl57MIdRCFDg@public.gmane.org> ) ? I think you two should really start working on the new 
framework instead of bending drivers all around.

Not yet, so please bring it up in the discussion there :)

The quad mode didn't need any new hooks in the m25p80, did it ? That's the 
difference here.

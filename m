As Paul said in a previous email, we are well aware of that issue. This 
is something I will work on for the future OMAP4 variants.
Since these files are manually done on OMAP2 & 3 and generated for 
OMAP4, it will require some time and a bunch of scripts to manage easily 
the delta between OMAP2, 3 and 4.
It should be much more straightforward for OMAP4 and beyond.

Regards,
Benoit

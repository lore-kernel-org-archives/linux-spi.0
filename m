I see. But with this we are back to statically mapping the MBus
windows that are used. Resulting in potentially multiple windows
per SPI controller, which is not necessary (Andrew and Mark
objected against that).

Sure, if its statically mapped (via 'ranges' in the soc node),
then this is easy to implement in the driver. Its similar to what
the RFC version of the patch did.

Currently, only a very limited number of SPI devices will support
it. As its really only useful right now for full-speed tx-transfer.
In my case its downloading a bitstream into a FPGA (only SPI
writes). In the future, SPI NOR flash devices can be supported.
But this needs additional work. So SPI devices should not use
this direct access mode as default for now. It needs to get
opted-in via some DT property.

Thanks,
Stefan

PS: I'm off into Easter vacation in a few hours. So I will follow-up
on this earliest in week 14.

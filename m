Dubious is a good word for this. ;-)

I was hoping that we could try to get away with this anyway. If someone
complains, we can always change it back, right? And if no one complains, then
did we really break anything?

I'll have to play around with the a default SPI_CS_WORD implementation first
to make sure it won't influence this either.

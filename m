Hrm, they are for different use.dma_request_slave_channel()/_reason() is for
drivers only working via DT or ACPI while
dma_request_slave_channel_compat()/_reason() is for drivers expected to run=
 in
DT/ACPI or legacy mode as well.

I added the dma_request_slave_channel_compat_reason() because OMAP/daVinci
drivers are using this to request channels - they need to support DT and
legacy mode.

But it is doable to do this for both the non _compat and _compat version:
1. change all users to check IS_ERR_OR_NULL(chan)
 return the PTR_ERR if not NULL, or do whatever the driver was doing in case
of chan =3D=3D NULL.
2. change the non _compat and _compat versions to do the same as the _reason
variants, #define the _reason ones to the non _reason names
3. Rename the _reason use to non _reason function in drivers
4. Remove the #defines for the _reason functions
5. Change the IS_ERR_OR_NULL(chan) to IS_ERR(chan) in all drivers
The result:
Both dma_request_slave_channel() and dma_request_slave_channel_compat() will
return ERR_PTR in case of failure or in success they will return the pinter=
 to
chan.

Is this what you were asking?
It is a bit broader than what this series was doing: taking care of
OMAP/daVinci drivers for deferred probing regarding to dmaengine ;)

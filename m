Sorry, to be clear It doesn't depend on n-theory instead it divergent
based on the how many Linux stacks that the GQSPI handle. And also I
commented earlier on thread that it may not be a better solutions but
it could be one of the good approach to fit into Linux-where-it's-not
touching core stacks.

Yes, we can do by adding spi bus driver and adding the
generic-ness,but I'm feel it ended up talking to many stacks which is
advisably not a good idea.

I agreed the protocol driver definition here,as per the spi-nor
framework the drivers/mtd/spi-nor driver not only a protocol or slave
or flash drivers but there are some controller driver as well ex:
fsl-qspi-spi-nor.c

OK, we both are in different directions - lets wait for any more
comments from others.

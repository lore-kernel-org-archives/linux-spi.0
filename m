Hi Peter,

Thanks a bunch for fixing this up!

I think overall I am happy with the proposal and aligning with 2 APIs really
_helps_.

I think that is okay for now, we can align on that eventually. I think this
doesn't impact the API design though..

That sounds right, for the third case would the arch, driver or someone else
configure this?

Are you marking the current APIs as dericated in the end of this series

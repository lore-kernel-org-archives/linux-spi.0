I guess this means that most IPs continue to get more missed sync events
even after the first sync event is generated at end of MAX_NR_SG PaRAMs.
And may be even that first sync event miss is a problem because the IP
does not pause and ends up shifting data in the shift register anyway.

If this is so broken, should edma driver not refuse to handle more than
MAX_NR_SG for all transfers but mem-to-mem transfers?

Thanks,

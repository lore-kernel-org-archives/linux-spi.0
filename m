I would like to keep these two changes separately since I have a small 
concern about this exact change.

Let's assume such scenario:
- ECSPI configured to use DMA in device tree and DMA controller 
description specified. But there is no driver for this controller in kernel.
In this case dmaengine will always return -EDEFER and driver postpone 
spi-imx initialization. So finally there will be no SPI support even in 
PIO mode.
Or for example spi-imx will be compiled into kernel, but DMA controller 
driver will be on SPI-NOR based rootfs.

So the question is "Should we allow user to use incorrect combination of 
kernel configuration and DTS and work at least with some limitation?" Or 
should we try to guarantee device tree file requirement to use DMA.

Any thoughts?

Regards, Anton

Actually there was a discussion in the past where we decided include
both the src and dst endpoint names in this property so that there is
some symmetry with the "interconnects" property. It would be nice to be
consistent across different drivers at least for now.
If we want to denote the master and slave ports here, my two cents would
be for "qup-mem" and "cpu-qup" or something similar?

Thanks,
Georgi

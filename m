Some devices have incredibly bogus hardware like 28 bit addressing
or 39 bit addressing.  We don't have a good way to allocate memory by
physical address other than than saying "GFP_DMA for anything less than
32, GFP_DMA32 (or GFP_KERNEL on 32-bit) for anything less than 64 bit".

Even CMA doesn't have a "cma_alloc_phys()".  Maybe that's the right place
to put such an allocation API.

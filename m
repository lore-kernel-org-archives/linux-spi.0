So you mean something like the following:

mmc_regulator_set_power(...)
{
	if (host->vcc) {
		...
	}

	if (host->pdata && host->pdata->setpower)
		host->pdata->setpower(mmc_dev(host->mmc), vdd);
}

I like  the idea, the only concern I have is that the mmc host drivers=20
can call 'vcc' and 'pdata' and 'setpower' with arbitrary names, what is=20
the kernel practice in cases like this where we want to use some common=20
code accessing driver-specific structures? I can think to three=20
alternatives right now:

  1. Consider only code currently in mainline (names are consistently=20
     vcc, pdata and setpower) and use a _macro_ based on that, assuming=20
     than future patches are going to copy the var names anyways.

  2. Add a proper function with all the needed parameters to abstract
     the actual var names, this would be something like:
     mmc_regulator_set_power(mmc, power_mode, vdd, vcc, pdata)
     and yet checking for pdata->setpower can be tricky as 'setpower'=20
     is an arbitrary name.

  3. Move stuff from driver structures to subsystem structures, which I=20
     don't think is needed in this case.

  4. (The hidden lazy one) make the code equal across all the drivers
     so new drivers copying it will be consistent, but still leave it=20
     duplicate.

Regards,
   Antonio

OK, it's indeed fairly easy to add a fixed rate divide-by-two clock,
but for the older SoCs we would need to also model the internal mux, gate,
and an 8-bit divider.  Then it becomes a bit bigger task. Anyway it might
be worth to try it, this could let us deprecate the samsung,spi-src-clk
property and for all the SoCs use assigned-clock-parents.

Yes, unless you move the definition of the filter function into
arch/arm/common/edma.c or arch/arm/mach-davinci/devices.c, but that
would require other changes.

Ok, just go ahead with your current patch then, we can always follow up.
The most important cleanup for edma is elsewhere anyway, so once the asoc
drivers can use the dmaengine interface, this should be easier.

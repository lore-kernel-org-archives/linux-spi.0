I have atleast one evidence of VIVT aliasing causing problem. Please see
this thread on DMA issues with davinci-spi driver
https://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg563420.html
https://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg563445.html

Not really, I am debugging another issue with UBIFS on DRA74 EVM (ARM
cortex-a15) wherein pages allocated by vmalloc are in highmem region
that are not addressable using 32 bit addresses and is backed by LPAE.
So, a 32 bit DMA cannot access these buffers at all.
When dma_map_sg() is called to map these pages by spi_map_buf() the
physical address is just truncated to 32 bit in pfn_to_dma() (as part of
dma_map_sg() call). This results in random crashes as DMA starts
accessing random memory during SPI read.

IMO, there may be more undiscovered caveat with using dma_map_sg() for
non kmalloc'd buffers and its better that spi-nor starts handling these
buffers instead of relying on spi_map_msg() and working around every
time something pops up.

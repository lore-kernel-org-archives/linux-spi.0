[ Since I hadn't seen this version yet, repeating comment from the
  previous version so it doesn't get lost. ]

I think this is a good fix to the existing problem.  One minor nit on a
comment below, otherwise:

It's not the *device* tha needs to be properly suspended after the probe
(since it's already/still runtime suspended), but the pm_domain that
would be potentially powered down.  Hence, I'd reword the last sentence
slightly:

   This ensures that a device which enables runtime PM in suspended
   state, and never transitions to active in its probe handler gives an
   opportunity for the PM domain to be powered down after the probe.

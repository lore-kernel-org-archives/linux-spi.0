I'm asking because it's actually OK to do this, I was more asking whether it
was really needed by any platforms...

We clk_disable() at runtime_suspend() and clk_enable() at runtime resume,
and the driver gives hints to the runtime PM layer to autosuspend the
driver whenever it's unused. Check the pm_runtime_* calls.

This clock is the one for the external bus. In some designs these two
clocks are one and the same, and these won't currently get into any clock
disabled states, sadly. (We need to fix that some day.)

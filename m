Noted.

Here in spi_bitbang_setup, we do:
bitbang->chipselect(spi, BITBANG_CS_INACTIVE);
That is, we make sure that the current device is _not_ selected.

Looking a bit more into this, the issue here is that some drivers use
chipselect to chip select individual devices separately, while, on
others, the above command unselects all devices (which is a bad idea
if the bus is currently transferring data...). So, in short, it's
probably better not to touch this code.

Regarding deleting prepare/unprepare and moving the lock into transfer_one.

spi.c:__spi_pump_messages, which calls these functions, does the following:
 - If no more messages need to be sent, call unprepare_transfer_hardware
 - If messages need to be sent:
   + call prepare_transfer_hardware
   + call prepare_message (NULL for bitbang)
   + call transfer_one_message

I don't think it makes a big difference if we set busy (or hold a
mutex) in prepare/unprepare, or we just do it in transfer_one_message,
since chipselect is only set in transfer_one_message, and is
deselected at the end of the function anyway (in most cases, and if
it's not, it will be selected again at the next transfer anyway).

Anyway, the "safer" way to fix this would be to keep the
prepare/unprepare functions, busy variable, and just protect it with a
mutex instead of a spinlock...

Thanks.

Best,

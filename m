Disclaimer: I am not familiar with the hardware for which this patch
adds support.

However, I am familiar m25p80.c and as I understand it the controller
is basically supposed to implement m25p80.c in hardware when this flag
is set.

If I was using m25p80.c to talk to anything but an actual flash chip
it would get me quite worried.

Thanks

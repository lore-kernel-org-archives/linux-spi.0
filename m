There are two microchip devices with a property like "microchip,hw-addr"
that I pointed out on ?v3? (whichever thread had the long discussion) that
do the exact same thing as this device.
I did ask that the submitter convert those to the new property as
evidence that this is actually generic, but that request was not
implemented. If done at the device level, this should be trivial, as the
microchip devices don't actually have support for multiple devices on
the same cs in the drivers, they just parse the property to correctly
support a single device.

I kinda wanted it to be in the channels, but I think, on reflection,
that putting it at the device level is probably fine. Pretending
that two devices are one extended device is always going to have some
ickyness about presentation, and putting it in the channels means
defining it again and again and again for each type of device that wants
it.

Ping. I'm also experiencing this issue with multiple devices on the
same spi bus; access seems completely unsynchronized. While it's hard
to rule out the possibility of it being specific to the spi master
driver, the driver just implements transfer_one and set_cs, so
synchronization would necessarily have to happen at a higher level.
Any tips on how I could further track down the cause?

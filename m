I had considered that and discarded it. The SX1301 has not just two CS
registers though but also two pairs of addr, data registers. That speaks
for two masters with a single chip-select each, unless I'm
misunderstanding the meaning of the registers.

Node names should not repeat the chipset, that goes into compatible.

lora-concentrator@0?

I would still find it cleaner to have (a) sub-node(s) for the radios.

Datasheet says 10 MHz, why 8 MHz?

reset-gpios?

No wildcards in bindings please, use concrete "semtech,sx1257".

Datasheet says 10 ns - I reported to Semtech that it should probably say
10 MHz, too.

Might we configure that on the sx1301 instead?

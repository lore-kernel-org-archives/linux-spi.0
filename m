I looked more into this, and it seems this particular problem is related
to probe order within SPI (and a special case with chip selects). The
panel driver on N900 is spi1.2. It's listed in the board file before
spi1.0 (touch controller). When the panel driver is probed, SPI transfers
appear to work (no errors) but all returned data zero:

If I modify the board file so that child spi1.0 is registered before
spi1.2, then it starts to work properly:

[    1.601867] omap2_mcspi omap2_mcspi.1: registered child spi1.2

So an altenative hack to fix this is to modify the board file
(board-rx51-peripherals.c):

	 /* list all spi devices here */
	 enum {
	 	RX51_SPI_WL1251,
	-	RX51_SPI_MIPID,		/* LCD panel */
	 	RX51_SPI_TSC2005,	/* Touch Controller */
	+	RX51_SPI_MIPID,		/* LCD panel */
	 };

I guess the proper fix would be to modify SPI core so that it first does
spi_setup for all the children/chip selects, before calling any of the
probe functions of SPI devices? (Initializing the controller driver at
subsys_initcall is one way to accomplish this.)

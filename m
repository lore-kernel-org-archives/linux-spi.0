This approach handles an off-mode transition during suspend, but if
off-mode is enabled, you can also have an off-mode transition during
idle.

Since you didn't describe what the conflicts you're seeing are, I would
assume that you'll have the same problems in idle as in suspend, and
this series doesn't address the idle case.

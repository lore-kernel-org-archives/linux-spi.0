The fsl-quadspi controller can support the DDR quad mode unconditionally.
In the other word, this controller is _designed_ for the DDR quad mode.

the driver does not needs a DT binding for the DDR. thanks.

We can not handle it in the software way.
Why? since there are too many modes,and each mode needs different dummy
cycles. Even the same chips, different versions may uses different dummy
cycles in the same mode. ..

You can refer to the Spansion's  S25fs128s.

If you want to put these dummy cycles in the device ID, it will make you
crazy in the end. :)

This is indeed a probably of the flash device.
and this is why I add a new DT binding file for the flash.

see the my comment above.

I think different chip vendors may have different format to store the
info, just like the read-retry for nand chips.

do you want to add the code only available for Spansion?
What's more the code will be very long, i think.

Add a new DT binding file for the flash maybe is the simplest way.

I am glad you can spend some time on this issue.

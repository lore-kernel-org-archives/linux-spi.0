Its not silently ignored (dev_err above) but I agree, we should be
able to fall back to PIO mode in this condition. I'll change this in
v4.

Okay, I'll add max_transfer_size() to v4.

Frankly, I have no idea if bidirectional transfers work properly.
I have no means to test it. As stated in the commit text, this 
direct mode is only tested for TX as this is the mode that I'm using
for the FPGA bitstream programming. So its perhaps best to remove the
RX path completely from the direct mode for now. It can be added
once someone has a board / platform that can make use of this direct
RX mode.

'bits_per_word_mask' is controller specific. And one controller may
have PIO SPI devices connected additionally to direct mode
SPI devices. So restricting this controller to 8 bit in general
doesn't seem to be a good idea to me. I can add a check for 16bit
to the direct mode and fall back to PIO mode though.

The connection between the CS and the window is done in the DT. All
is now implemented as Arnd has suggested:

I've Cc'ed you on the Armada dts patches as well. The only board
currently enabling this direct mode via the 'ranges' property in the
'soc' node is an Armada XP based board that is still out-of-tree.
I'll send the patches for it at some later time.

Thanks,
Stefan

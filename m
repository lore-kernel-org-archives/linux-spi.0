We kind of realized that too, in the early days for ux500. At that
point we converted it to a use a dedicated work queue, which improved
the behaviour, don't remember the details why, but maybe I should
collect the patches and send them out. :-)

Finally we moved to use a separate GPIO irq as a dedicated SDIO irq
line for our cw1200 wlan chip, mostly due to gain a bit of
performance. That happened to simplified the mmci part as well, which
was welcome.

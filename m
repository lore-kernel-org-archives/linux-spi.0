There are subtle register differences between RSPI on SH7757 and RZ/A1H,
cfr. what rspi_parse_platform_data() does when no platform_data is passed[*].
RSPI on RZ/A1H seems to be an evolutionary step from RSPI on SH towards
QSPI on RCar Gen2 (but without Dual/Quad).

[*] setup-sh7757.c doesn't pass platform data, although the rspi driver and its
    platform data has     support for DMA on SH7757, which is not used by
    setup-sh7757.c nor any other in-tree platform.

So we end up with:

compatible = "renesas,sh7757", "renesas,rspi-sh" (SH legacy)
compatible = "renesas,rspi-r7s72100", "renesas,rspi-rz" (Genmai)
compatible = "renesas,rspi-r8a7790", "renesas,qspi" (Lager)
compatible = "renesas,rspi-r8a7791", "renesas,qspi" (Koelsch)

did you look at the generated code ?  function pointers requires
pointer loads and indirect calls.  telling gcc that the function is
completely static allows for direct calls (and thus less register
pressure) and if gcc gets clever enough, avoid call overhead.

that doesnt make sense.  if it's labeled "start" and "end" in the
local function, it's pretty obvious.

yes, a new BUS_SPI should be added

that doesnt make sense.  the entire purpose of writing these helper
write/read functions is because people often do just that -- write a
few then read a few.  your concerns are purely superficial.

Cool. There are still 2 things I think should be addressed before
merging the driver:
1/ Fixing the SoB tag to match the author (problem reported by
   Alexandre)
2/ Getting this patch [1] merged and implementing the ->get_name() hook
   in this driver so that SPI NOR devs declared to the MTD layer keep
   the same name after the transition to spi-mem and mtdparts= passed on
   the cmdline keep working. Without this in place we're likely to
   break a few setups :-/.

Sure, I can provide an immutable tag for you to pull and I'll add my
acks on those patches once the 2 things I mentioned above are
addressed.

Boris

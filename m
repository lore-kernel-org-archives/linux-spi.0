These patches have not been specifically tested on 29 kernel, but you could 
give it a shot. Pl also look at the latest patches (V2) posted.

To set any mcspi controller to slave mode, you need to modify 
arch/arm/mach-omap2/devices.c file and set mode to OMAP2_MCSPI_SLAVE.

Typically gpio is used by master to notify the slave that it is ready to 
transfer data. On gpio interrupt slave client could issue spi_read/spi_write 
commands.

Two modes are supported i.e PIO and DMA. Any specific reason not to use DMA 
mode.

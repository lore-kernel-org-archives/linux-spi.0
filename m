Nope.  I checked the actual compiled code.  Each bool takes another
parameter.  Since the txrx functions are large and called from
multiple sites, they are not inlined.  Gcc is not able to combine all
the bool arguments into one single bitfield argument.

On arm, to check if an argument on the stack is true requires two
instructions.  First an ldr to move the argument into a register and
then a cmp to check it for zero.  Checking for a bit is the basically
the same, first an ldr and then a tst.  So there is no performance
advantage of "if(x)" vs "if(x&32)".  But, if one uses bit flags then
the same flag word can be used for every flag, avoiding the need to
load a different word for each flag.

So using the flags avoids extra instructions in the caller for each
call to place each flag in its own boolean on the stack or in an
argument register (depending on the # of function arguments), and then
avoids extra code in the callee to load any arguments on the stack
into a register.  It can make code in loops faster and smaller by
using fewer register and avoiding a register load inside the loop.

BTW, after converting the code to bool arguments instead of flags:
add/remove: 0/0 grow/shrink: 4/0 up/down: 130/0 (130)
function                                     old     new   delta

mxs_spi_txrx_pio                             492     508     +16
mxs_spi_txrx_dma                            1188    1204     +16
__UNIQUE_ID_vermagic0                         73      79      +6

Bool arguments for each flag is larger than using one argument and bit
flags.  And there are more flags needed to support things like GPIO CS
lines.

Well, by De Morgan's law the two expressions are the same.  And they
are the same number of characters.  And both will produce a compile
time constant and thus the same code.  However, I like the ~FOO & ~BAR
& ~BAR form better as there is greater parallelism between each term
of the expression.

Don't have SPI flash.  I did test with logic analyzer and the current
code is clearly broken and my changes clearly fix it.  It should be
obvious from looking a the code that it is wrong.  The DMA does write
ctrl0 on each segment of each transfer, but look at the previous
paragraph to see where it comes from.  Once READ or IGNORE_CRC are
set, nothing will clear them until PIO mode is used.  It's the same
with the bug fix for 3.9 that clears the XFER_COUNT bits in DMA mode.
Strangely, I didn't notice that bug since all my xfers are the same
length!  But I do switch between slaves, between read and write, and
use messages with multiple transfers, in DMA mode, all of which are
broken in the current driver.

Whatis ?  Setting the DMA direction or using flags?

Look at it this way:

Existing code that uses the first/last flags is wrong and needs to be
changed.  Therefor code using 'first' and 'last' will be changed.

Passing the flags as pointers is bad practice and makes no sense to
do.  Does it make any sense to re-write code fix the way it uses first
and last, then re-write those same lines a second time to not use
pointers?

If the way the flags are passed should change, then why not do it the
most efficient way.  It isn't any more complicated and produces better
code.  One flag per parameter becomes cumbersome when more flags are
added for additional features.

I'm all for splitting my patches up.  I sent five patches when I bet 9
out 10 developers would have just done one.  But I don't think it
makes any sense to re-write the same line of code over and over again
in successive patches in a series before getting to the final version.
 It just makes more churn to review.

I hate it when I get a series of patches and spot a flaw, take the
time to write up the flaw and how it should be fixed, only to discover
that the flaw is fixed later on in the series and I wasted my time.

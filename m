I made a mess with the patches... the second one of this set _is_ mmc-o=
ver-spi
converted to this generalization. Instead I sent GPIO OF stuff... sorry=

I agree, indeed I'm not able to use these helpers within the s3c-mmc dr=
iver
without duplicating and writing ugly code.

I made some "research" so I have few patches of tries which made me lea=
rn
a bit. There is not a common management of these as well as of the
set_power() callbacks, to say those I learned about looking at S3C MMC.

In practice also MMC platform datas require some consolidation.

Kgene, Ben, do you plan to work on the S3C MCI driver? Can I spend some
time on it without duplicating the effort of anybody?

Regards,
Domenico

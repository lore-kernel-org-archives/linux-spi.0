Hi Erwin,

Thanks for the comments.

You can trust me on this point:) it has worked reliably on our HW platform
for long time. I don't know if Alan has played with the platform, but
David Woodhouse has, max3110's console is one of the main debug methods
for developers.

Actually it can co-work well with other SPI devices connecting to the
same SPI controller(our platform use a Designware core based controller)

Our SPI controller can handle this (drivers/spi/dw_spi.c), it has a
dedicated chip select register for handling chip select. And this part
is transparent for all SPI slave devices connecting to the controller

We are running on x86 architecture, with little endian. But endian issue is
a good point

Yes, I let the SPI controller driver handle this, which has a rather
big FIFO. And structure spi_transfer has a member "speed_hz", this driver
set it according to current UART baud rate, then SPI controller driver will
adjust the bus frequency between controller and 3110 accordingly to prevent
its overflow, which will avoid explicit delay in driver

I agree there should not be 2 drivers cover 1 family of HW, so this is a RFC.
I've thinked about merge with current 3100 code, but it depends on one char
per spi_transfer, while my driver relys on batch data transfer for efficiency.
Another key point is the console, SPI UART can't be directly accessed by
CPU, so every spi_transfer will go through tasklet/workqueue, which makes
supporting printk a big part of my driver.


Thanks,

Yeah. It's probably bad thing to spend that much time in interrupt
handler.

I tested your version with few SD cards (one of them is SDHC) and
works without any problems (and performance is better). Also tested
with SPI EEPROM through at25 driver and it works well.

However, I would really like to have this code to be simpler and
to be suitable for polling as well. I wrote myself version that is
based on yours and also borrowed this fifo_level thingy from
amba-pl022 driver. I tested it with the same devices and performance
seems to be in par with your version.

Can you try following with your devices?

struct ep93xx_spi {
	...
	size_t	fifo_level;
};

static int ep93xx_spi_read_write(struct ep93xx_spi *espi)
{
        struct spi_message *msg;
        struct spi_transfer *t;
        unsigned long flags;

        spin_lock_irqsave(&espi->lock, flags);
        msg = espi->current_msg;
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&espi->lock, flags);

        t = msg->state;

        if (espi->tx == 0 && espi->rx == 0)
                espi->fifo_level = 0;

        while ((ep93xx_spi_read_u8(espi, SSPSR) & SSPSR_RNE) &&
                espi->rx < t->len) {
                ep93xx_do_read(espi, t);
                espi->fifo_level--;
        }

        while (espi->fifo_level < 8 && espi->tx < t->len) {
                ep93xx_do_write(espi, t);
                espi->fifo_level++;
        }

        /* is transfer finished? */
        if (espi->tx == t->len && espi->rx == t->len) {
                msg->actual_length += t->len;
                return t->len;
        }

        return 0;
}

I'd like to answer, but I'm not sure which "other spi related fixes"
you're referring to.  If you mean patches 1 and 3 of this series, then
obviously.  If you mean something else then probably not.

[PATCH 1/3] lib/crc7: Shift crc7() output left 1 bit
[PATCH 3/3] drivers/net/wireless/ti/wl*/spi.c: Simplify CRC computation


As there seems to be no objection to sending the mmc change via the
wireless tree, are they ready to be queued there?

The additional reviews are:
All 3: Reviewed-by: Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>
2/3: Reviewed-by: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert@linux-m68k.org>
2/3: Acked-by: Ulf Hansson <ulf.hansson@linaro.org>

I can resend everything with the additional signoff lines
if that's easier for you.

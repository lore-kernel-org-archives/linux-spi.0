Hi David,

I agree that DMA working mode must not use stack as IO buffer, and spi =
core
code(spi.c/spi.h) has clearly message stating that. But this driver doe=
sn't
intend to use DMA by design. In early version of this patch there is so=
me
controller specific data which show "enable_dma =3D 0".

The reason of not using DMA for Maxim 3110 is, it is a low speed SPI UA=
RT
device, which only has one word (16b) TX buffer and 8 words RX buffer, =
using
DMA may benefit in some use case but will be over-kill for others. This
driver implement a console,  take one example of editing a file on the =
console,
each char we input will be echoed back on screen, which will use a spi_=
message
and a spi_transfer, if using DMA, that DMA operation length will be 2 b=
ytes,
if the file been edited has 4K characters, there will be 4K DMA transac=
tions,
which will occupy quiet some system load.=20

Also whether a 16b word could be DMAed is still a question for some typ=
es of
DMA controllers, I know some platform whose DMA controllers can only  o=
r
configured to only work with data at least 32 bits aligned.=20

So in this driver, it leverages some options provided by SPI controller=
 drivers
(pxa2xx and Designware) to chose not using DMA.=20

Thanks,

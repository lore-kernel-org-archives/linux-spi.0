Well, there's a proposal from Maxime to add 'dma-memory' or something. 
You all need to sort this out.

I assume config or cpu-qup is for register access? Why is this needed? 
That should get described thru the DT tree. The interconnect stuff was 
supposed to be for the non-cpu centric view (i.e. DMA masters). Maybe 
it's fine, but that's not my initial reaction.

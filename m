There might be some confusion with the term, I am referring to slave
hotplug, not controller hotplug.

The way I see it, there are two logical operations: probe of a
controller and the associated enumeration of the SPI slaves for that
bus and "hotplug" of new SPI slaves and the enumeration of those
particular slaves.

When we probe the controller we search DT/ACPI and enumerate all the
slaves for *that* controller.

When a slave hotplug happens for device tree we get a device node
notification and we can instantiate the SPI slave based on that info.
In case of ACPI, (at this point) we get a global callback and in that
callback we need to iterate through *all* controllers.

Everything is possible. 

I did think about having just one gpio controller, since as you said,
it makes it easier to describe gpios = <&gpio 71 0>; instead of gpios
= <&gpio3 7 0>; But most SoCs seem to have multiple GPIO controllers
in the .dtsi files. Only picoxcell has banks inside a single gpio
controller. So it would be a bit unusual.
 
What you suggest also adds a lot of complexity to the code and
probably means a lot less of the code can be shared with non-DT GPIO
handling code.

The natural size of a GPIO controller is 32 lines, not 8. The current
interrupt handling does not actually care which IRQ of a bank of 32
lines fired, it looks at all lines. The handler_data in the IRQ points
to the GPIO chip, not a subsection of the GPIO chip.

Some Orions mixed GPIOs GPOs and GPIs within one controller. So that
is not generic enough. Probably the pinmux DT description needs to be
able to specify per pin what a line can do.

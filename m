Yep, CYCLIC. How could I forgot that ;)

I think we can go with a single API, but I don't really like that:
dma_request_channel(dev, name, *mask, fn, fn_param);

This would cover all current uses being legacy, DT/ACPI, compat, etc:
dma_request_channel(NULL, NULL, &mask, fn, fn_param); /* Legacy slave */
dma_request_channel(NULL, NULL, &mask, NULL, NULL); /* memcpy. etc */
dma_request_channel(dev, name, NULL, NULL, NULL); /* DT/ACPI, current slave=
 */
dma_request_channel(dev, name, &mask, fn, fn_param); /* current compat */

Note, that we need "const dma_cap_mask_t *mask" to be able to make the mask
optional.

If we have two main APIs, one to request slave channels and one to get any
channel with given capability
dma_request_slave_channel(NULL, NULL, &mask, fn, fn_param); /* Legacy slave=
 */
dma_request_slave_channel(dev, name, NULL, NULL, NULL); /* DT/ACPI, current
							   slave */
dma_request_slave_channel(dev, name, &mask, fn, fn_param); /* current compa=
t*/

This way we can omit the mask also in cases when the client only want to get
DMA_SLAVE, we can just build up the mask within the function. If the mask is
provided we would copy the bits from the provided mask, so for example if y=
ou
want to have DMA_SLAVE+DMA_CYCLIC, the driver only needs to pass DMA_CYCLIC,
the DMA_SLAVE is going to be set anyways.

dma_request_channel(mask); /* memcpy. etc, non slave mostly */

Not sure how to name this as reusing existing (good, descriptive) function
names would mean changes all over the kernel to start off this.

Not used and
request_dma_channel(); /* as _irq/_mem_region/_resource, etc */
request_dma();
dma_channel_request();

All in all, not sure which way would be better...

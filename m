I call BS on that, and you actually explain later why it it BS due
to some drivers using it more explicitly.  But even more importantly
we have plenty driver using it through dma_alloc_* and a small DMA
mask, and they are in use - we actually had a 4.16 regression due to
them.

Not really.  We have unchecked_isa_dma to support about 4 drivers,
and less than a hand ful of drivers doing stupid things, which can
be fixed easily, and just need a volunteer.

All that code is long gone and replaced with dma-direct.  Which still
uses GFP_DMA based on the dma mask, though - see above.

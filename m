So what you're saying here is that you just need a property for the
inability to read back the chip select status?  That seems like a
totally reasonable thing to have which fits in idiomatically with the
rest of the subsystem.  I might call it no-cs-readback or something.

I disagree, I think from a system integration point of view this is just
a chip select which can't be changed and it's less likely that we will
run into nasty surprises later on with things assuming that chip selects
exist.  AFAICT you only need this property in your case because this
controller has some features that rely on readback of the chip select
status, that's not very common - normally it'd be write only.  I'd
expect most controllers would just say they have one chip select and
that'd be that.

Hi All,

Based on the discussion for v8, I plan to:

1) Drop the Microchip-related patches from this series
2) Keep the spi-device-addr property and the AD5529R binding/driver and represent AD5529R sharing one CS as one device using the address array.

This would reduce v8 into just three patches related to the AD5529r.

Please let me know if I missed anything.

Regards,
Jan

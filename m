Ok. My SPI controller is relying on the pinctrl framework to request
these gpios and I didn't have that configured in DT.

Yes. There would need to be some hook into the SPI core from the driver
core that notified of any new driver probes. Then we could try and get
any pending cs-gpios again and then add the device that uses that chip
select.

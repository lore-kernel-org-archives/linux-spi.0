Yes, I can do that.

Without giving a full judgment on the framework yet (I haven't followed
as closely as I'd like), I expect that the SPI NOR API will cover the
needs of my SPI NOR hardware.

SPI is not used only for SPI NOR; it is useful for other things, like
communicating with off-chip peripherals or microcontrollers, supporting
touchscreens, LEDs, media controllers, etc. So with a SPI NOR framework
living only in the MTD subsystem, I have to write two drivers: one
(under drivers/spi/) to use only-(a) for controlling non-flash SPI
devices, and one (under drivers/mtd/) to manage (a)+(b) on SPI NOR
flash.

If, however, we can define a spi_nor_transfer like Angus suggested, and
if we take that a step further and make it a first-class (but optional)
citizen of the SPI framework, then we could have drivers that support
SPI-only, SPI-NOR-only, or both.

Now, I'm not sure how exactly that sort of proposal would work yet, but
I wanted to test the waters to see
  - if this is a complete distortion of what Angus or David may have
    suggested;
  - if Mark thinks this is reasonable, or if he thinks I'm spouting
    nonsense; and
  - if there is some obvious alternate way to support what I describe
    without moving the SPI-NOR layer into the SPI subsystem.

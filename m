Actually the setup is quite simple.
Say, the Peri-4 is the UART which could only be reached from DMAC-2.

DMAENGINE should simply manage a pool of total channels in the platform,
disregarding the dmacs they come from.

Each channel in the common pool will have a 'capability-tag' of u32 type - which
specifies various capabilities of the channel expressed in bit-fields.
It is the job of
platform (via dmac driver) to set 'tag' of each channel appropriately.
Among others, a channel's reach to a particular device is a
'capability' (expressed
in 7-bits DEV_TYPE field-mask of the 'tag')

In your case, while setting up channels before adding them to the common pool,
the platform (via dmac driver) will ensure exactly the channel which
can reach UART
has set DEV_UART value in the DEV_TYPE field of its capability-tag.

After all the dmac instances have been probed, _exactly_ one channel in the pool
will have the 'UART' capability mentioned in the DEV_TYPE field.

The serial driver(client), will simply specify 'Ability to reach UART'
as one of its
requirements to the core - by setting the DEV_TYPE field with DEV_UART value
of the 'request-tag' (a u32 number, say).

While searching for appropriate channel for the serial client, the core will
iterate over the pool and, of course, only one channel will have DEV_TYPE
field set to DEV_UART - the one which platform decided!

Please have a look at the end of  https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/7/29/211
(esp the helpers) to get an idea of data structures involved.

Well, that is between dmac and platform and out of scope of DMAENGINE API.
They can decide upon any data structure to pass the info needed.

But at some point someone must set :-
  _Only_ for the channel of DMAC-2 that could talk to the UART.

{
DCH_RESET_CAP(ch->tag);

/* Declare 'capability' to talk to UART */
SET_DEVTYPE(ch->tag, DCHAN_TODEV_UART);

/* Declare 'capability' to do RX i.e, P->M */
SET_DCHDIR(ch->tag,  0, 0, 1, 0);

/* Declare other 'capabilities' of the channel */

/* Add enough dmac's private data to channel so as to be able
  to later figure out the ReqSig, DMAC etc associated with it */

/* Add the channel to the global pool in dmaengine.c */
}

Thanks a lot for explaining...
It often(2/5) goes wrong within this simple function called when mounting the UBIFS filesystem w/o a priori any userspace interaction:
fs/ubifs/lpt.c:
static int read_ltab(struct ubifs_info *c)
{
    int err;
    void *buf;
    int retry=1;

    buf = vmalloc(c->ltab_sz);
    if (!buf)
        return -ENOMEM;
    err = ubifs_leb_read(c, c->ltab_lnum, buf, c->ltab_offs, c->ltab_sz, 1);
    if (err)
        goto out;
retry:
    err = unpack_ltab(c, buf);
    if (err && retry--) {
        pr_err("%s: flush cache %p[%d] and retry\n", __func__, buf, c->ltab_sz);
        invalidate_kernel_vmap_range(buf, c->ltab_sz);
        goto retry;
    }
out:
    vfree(buf);
    return err;
}
The retry code is added by me and with this code there is no error when retrying after flushing the cache. As you can see, the vmalloc'es buffer is allocated and freed within this function.
read_ltab: flush cache c9543000[11] and retry
Ok after this !!

Thanks again,
Frode

I thought to something like:

struct mmc_driver_ops {
	int (*setpower)(struct device *, unsigned int);
};

struct pxamci_platform_data {
	[...]
	struct mmc_driver_ops *ops;
};

static inline int mmc_regulator_set_power(struct mmc_host *mmc,
				 unsigned char	power_mode,
				 struct regulator *supply,
				 unsigned short vdd_bit,
				 struct device *device,
				 struct mmc_driver_ops ops)
{
	[...]
		if (ops->setpower)
			ops->setpower(device, vdd_bit);
	[...]
}

static inline int pxamci_set_power(struct pxamci_host *host,
				    unsigned char power_mode,
				    unsigned int vdd)
{
	[...]
	ret =3D mmc_regulator_set_power(host->mmc, power_mode, host->vcc,
				      vdd, mmc_dev(host->mmc),
				      host->pdata->ops);
	[...]
}

It is cleaner and more uniform indeed, but it does not solve the problem
I am seeing, the issue is still there when pdata is NULL, we are at the
same point as before (the current code checks for (pdata &&
pdata->field)), and we cannot pass pdata directly as a function argument
(can we?) as it is driver specific as well.

I would be glad to discover than I am still missing something :)

Thanks,
   Antonio

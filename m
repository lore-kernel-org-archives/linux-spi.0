Yes, I can see that PoV.

But ... we can't have it both ways.  *Either* it's a true MFD, in
which case it can/should have 2 separate compatible strings which can
be specified directly from the DT.  *Or* it's not an MFD.  In the
latter case, which I think we're all agreeing on (else we'd have 2
compatible strings), MFD is not the place to handle this (my original
point).

So ... this is a USART device which can do SPI, right?

My current thinking is that; as this is a USART device first &
foremost, the USART should be probed in the first instance regardless,
then if SPI mode is specified it (the USART driver) registers the SPI
platform driver (as MFD does currently) and exits gracefully, allowing
the SPI driver to take over.

Spanner in the works: is it physically possible to change the mode at
run-time?  :s

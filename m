sure. Exactly what I was thinking :-p

could be, but we already have separated clk, pm, cpuidle, mux and soon
to become devices. So pretty much the base support is already splitted,
then why not completely avoiding ifdefs also with dma (which today is
full of ifdefs and could be converted to a platform_device also).

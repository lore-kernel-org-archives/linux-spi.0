DEST_PER and SRC_PER in the DMA controller selects this, numbers placed=
 here
should match the table you most likely found, 9-3.

Wiring the handshake connections is done with the struct dw_dma_slave s=
rc_id
or dst_id member, depending on data direction. Configured in the at32ap=
700x.c
machine code.

It is not hard wired on avr32, as there are not one-to-one configuratio=
ns and
masters.

OK, I have no knowledge about the 460ex.

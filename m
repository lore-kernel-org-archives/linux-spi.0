Do I understand you correctly, that you want the complete MBus
allocation and configuration to be included in the SPI driver
instead of using the DT to describe the window (target, attribute,
area)? If yes, then the SPI driver would be the first driver
to do this "internally". All other drivers using MBus resources
parse these from the DT (AFAIK) as this is highly SoC specific.

Sidenote:
Please note that this direct access mode is really not suitable
for "normal" SPI devices like SPI NOR chips. As the direct read
mode (as described in chapter 22.5.1 of the Armada XP datasheet)
always generates:

a) a write command to the SPI bus (opcode configurable via register)

and

b) writes 1-4 address bytes to the SPI bus

before the data is read from the SPI bus.

So its definitely nothing that should be enabled per default for
all SPI devices. In my case of the FPGA bitstream loading, the
direct write mode is perfect, as it provides the fastest way to
stream the bitstream back-to-back onto the SPI bus.

Thanks,
Stefan

FYI, we never want to do pm_runtime_get_sync() from the irq handler as that
implies pm_runtime_irq_safe(). And pm_runtime_irq_safe() takes a permanent
use count on the parent device which is something we don't want to do. And
we need to fix in existing drivers to not rely on using pm_runtime_irq_safe().

The way to deal with having an event wake up a device is to configure a
generic wakeirq that then wakes up the device and have the interrupt handler
bail out early in the unlikely case the device is not awake when servicing
interrupts. And in some cases with clock autoidle we can just use cpu_pm
notifiers instead of PM runtime if the changes are related to SoC idle states.

Anyways, sounds like no need to do anything with these patches :)

Tony

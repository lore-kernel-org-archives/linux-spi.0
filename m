It's no explicitly improved to the driver, it only takes less bytes
in .secion modinfo from 644 bytes to 620 bytes in the observation with
objdump.

More importantly, it seems the driver should probably refer to another
qualified driver at the initial development, but MODULE_ALIAS is
forgetting to be removed to meet real usage for the module autoload. 

Even I was curious whether people for the driver know the actual purpose
the macro it's for.

Removing MODULE_ALIAS is just to correct the driver to where it should
be.

Adding an API to SPI core makes sense to me. This can take care of spi
bus locking and runtime pm.
But, I didn't get how to integrate with existing message queue. Memory
mapped read by-passes message queue of SPI core. Could you please
explain a bit more on integrating with message queue? Did you mean
locking the existing message queue when memory mapped read is being
requested?


Thanks,

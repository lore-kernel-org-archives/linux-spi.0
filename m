No problem, the board is still on the desk :)

I added a dev_err in *_port_read,write,update and *_fifo_read,write. No=
 regmap=20
function returned an error in my test, but the 255 read value is still =
there.

I digged a little deeper and did some measurements to support my idea.
I think the reason for the 255 read is that the chip does not support t=
he zero=20
length write.=20

The chip's SPI interface defines two sorts of frames. One for normal re=
gister=20
access, which is essentially an address followed by one byte of data, e=
ither=20
read or written.

The second type is for accessing the fifo. It has an address and two by=
tes of=20
data, by definition.=20

If the master now issues a zero length write, it sends only the address=
 byte,=20
but the chip will expect two following data bytes, which do not arrive.=
=20
Instead it will consume the following frame. When this frame is the tx =
fifo=20
level read, the chip will not drive its SO line (still expecting a fifo=
=20
write), and the master reads 255. Now two bytes were clocked, and they =
are=20
back in sync. However, the value is crap.

If my theorie is true, we would also have to make sure, that fifo acces=
s is=20
always two bytes to keep it synced. I will check this, and craft anothe=
r=20
patch, if neccessary.

I agree. I split the patch in two parts, because I would vote for patch=
 1/2=20
unconditionally, to prevent buffer overruns, whatever happens.=20
And then, use patch 2/2 only if it is the right solution.

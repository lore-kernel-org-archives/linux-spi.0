So for all practical purposes any typical active low interrupt line 
connected to a GPIO should be configured as TRIGGER_LOW in the
device tree.

Under this assumption:

There are actually quite a few drivers that are having a /INT
line, but are configured in the DT bindings as 2 - hence 
TRIGGER_FALLING.

Two of those are:
* Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/can/microchip,mcp251x.txt
* Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/microchip,enc28j60.txt

The enc28j60 does use flags = 0, which seems could be ok, as it is
not requesting some specific kind of irq, while the other
is using flags = IRQF_ONESHOT | IRQF_TRIGGER_FALLING, which is
incorrect.

That was one of the reasons why I was adding this subsequent question
for clarification.

So I wonder how one would go about correcting those devices...

It would have been a workaround which would not have been accepted
anyway.

When I have finished this driver I am working on right now, then
I may look into it in detail.

But if I remember the bits and pieces I have been looking at before
asking this question: I remember that there is some code in 
irq_create_fwspec_mapping that allows for first time initialization.

The best I can do is:
* in __setup_irq:
  * the Trigger-type flags are set to “defaults” if none are set
  * otherwise the flags are used without matching them against
    what is configured in the device tree.
  * so there is no validation happening in case the types disagree.

Something like this patch would trigger an error on first try 
(unless flags = 0 or flags = “correct”):

+       }

        /*

Patch is against 4.9.57 - please ignore the whitespace issue as it
is a simple console cut/paste. 

It does not trigger anything else on my system, but there may
be other use-cases that would fail because of this.

Here some of the debugging output (see the irq_flags module parameter)

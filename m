Sorry, there was some issue with my mail client, now I corrected it.

>From the flash point of view, it expects the controller to send the dummy
on 1/2/4 lines based on the command. For Quad commands, flash expects
4 lines to be active during dummy phase. Similarly, 2 lines for dual
Commands and 1 line for normal/fast commands.
Since len field contains total number of cmd+addr+dummy bytes,
host driver should take care of sending these bytes on their respective
bus widths. Knowing when the dummy is being sent also helps in
the correct switching of IO pads (since the data lines are bidirectional)
ZynqMP GQSPI is a generic controller, majorly interfaced to flash devices.
It seems reasonable for it to know the above information from
the flash layer. Adding "dummy" cycles entry should be useful to any
controller that cares about it without affecting other spi/qspi controllers.

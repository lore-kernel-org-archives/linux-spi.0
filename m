This is a v2 of the RFC posted earlier by Stephen Boyd [1]

As part of v2 I still follow the same approach of dev_pm_opp_set_rate()
API using clk framework to round the frequency passed and making it
accept 0 as a valid frequency indicating the frequency isn't required
anymore. It just has a few more drivers converted to use this approach
like dsi/dpu and ufs.
ufs demonstrates the case of having to handle multiple power domains, one
of which is scalable.

The patches are based on 5.1-rc1 and depend on some ufs fixes I posted
earlier [2] and a DT patch to include the rpmpd header [3]

Rajendra Nayak (10):
  OPP: Make dev_pm_opp_set_rate() with freq=0 as valid
  tty: serial: qcom_geni_serial: Use OPP API to set clk/perf state
  spi: spi-geni-qcom: Use OPP API to set clk/perf state
  arm64: dts: sdm845: Add OPP table for all qup devices
  scsi: ufs: Add support to manage multiple power domains in
    ufshcd-pltfrm
  scsi: ufs: Add support for specifying OPP tables in DT
  arm64: dts: sdm845: Add ufs opps and power-domains
  drm/msm/dpu: Use OPP API to set clk/perf state
  drm/msm: dsi: Use OPP API to set clk/perf state
  arm64: dts: sdm845: Add DSI and MDP OPP tables and power-domains

Stephen Boyd (1):
  OPP: Don't overwrite rounded clk rate

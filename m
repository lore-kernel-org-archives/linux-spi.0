Sorry for missing that.

the slave ID only makes sense in combination with the master device
it is used in, so the dependency exists already.

Yes, that would be best. IIRC you have a single PCI device that instantiates
both the SPI and the DMA engine as subdevices (I haven't looked at the
code again), so that information would be readily available.

It seems correct to me. This is the filter function used by atmel_mci:

static bool atmci_filter(struct dma_chan *chan, void *pdata)
{
        struct mci_platform_data *sl_pdata = pdata;
        struct mci_dma_data *sl;

        if (!sl_pdata)
                return false;

        sl = sl_pdata->dma_slave;
        if (sl && find_slave_dev(sl) == chan->device->dev) {
                chan->private = slave_data_ptr(sl);
                return true;
        } else {
                return false;
        }
}

It sets the dw_dma_slave information from  slave_data_ptr(sl) here,
and does not attempt to set a slave_id at all, the slave_config
call only sets the required fields.

Do you still see a problem here?

I don't see how: We have four cases that I am aware of, and all seem
to handle this right:

a) request line and masters are all configured from device-tree.
b) request line is configured from ACPI, masters are autoconfigured
c) request line and masters are all configured from avr32/arm32
   platform data.
d) request line and masters are all configured from Bay Trail
   PCI ID (Implemented by Mika's patch)

The ACPI case could be extended if we ever get an ACPI based system
that has more than two masters.
In the other cases, the same source of information that configures
the request line also configures the masters, so it's up to the
system integration to pick the best setting.

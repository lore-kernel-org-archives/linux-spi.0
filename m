There I would partly disagree. Fixing the spi driver clearly makes sense
but the serial driver should be batching better. Is there a reason the
driver couldn't adjust the size based upon the tty speed when getting a
termios request ?

For serial flow control it doesn't matter, its implicitly asynchronous
and if you only turn the fifo on at high speed you response time will be
reasonably bounded.

Consoles are not usually balanced for I/O. I grant you probably don't
want to be using full fifo sized blocks but I'm not sure I understand why
there is a problem below that ?

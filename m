I disagree we should bloat the API with features, that will be used by "possible 
future controllers" or "possible single controller", right from the start. The 
real question here is, can the API be designed in such a way, that the SR 
polling will happen in software NOW and only when a controller appears that can 
do polling in HW will the API be extended to support it ?

Sounds good!

That then requires every single user to open code this which immediately
suggests that there should be a helper which is going to look a lot like
any generic implementation.

I'd imagine that the much bigger problem is that you end up with
enormous numbers of operations for any non-trivial transfers which is
going to happen anyway.  It's really only the copying bit that's at all
an overhead here.

Ah, good - I'd forgotten it was there and didn't spot it when I went to
check.

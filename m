Key detail is not just aggregate devices but have them act as one device
from an interface point of view (just like SPI chaining).  One message
affects multiple devices.

If they were child nodes that just means we have a device specific binding
and in practice ends up the same as a binding that just makes it one device.

adc@cs {

	adc@spi-device-addr0 {
		spi-device-addr =3D spi-device-addr0;
	};
	adc@spidevice-addr1 {
		spi-device-addr =3D spi-device-addr1;
	};
}

Fun question of where we do the xlate for references to channels so
does a consumer point at the outer node or the inner one?

I'm not seeing a gain over having an array of spi-device-addr in the
top level node.

Agreed though if there is an array it will be first spi-addr.  That
should be fine.

The reason we ended up reusing the platform bus so much was that
originally people were doing custom buses but people started complaining
that the code was (or should be) a cut'n'paste of the platform bus and
that this duplication was both not pretty and a bit tedious for anyone
doing anything that involved deploying good practice over a lot of
buses.  Early MFDs were actually MMIO devices so the platform bus was a
good fit, then people (including me when I upstreamed the wm97xx drivers
and apparently whoever worked on these devices) started adding custom
buses and then people complianed that we should reuse both the bus type
and the MFD infrastructure so here we are.

Probably a way of sharing the platform code but giving the bus another
name and bus_type would allow for better separation here.

I tend to think there is something other wrong with your setup. Maybe you are
missing bus-termination/biasing? Chip-clock?
The device should never go in bus-off mode if there are RX-overruns. If it
goes into bus-off, there is something wrong in the hardware.

We use a MCP2515 with this driver at 250kbit/s receiving back-to-back messages
without loss on a i.MX51. Please note, that it won't work reliably at any
higher bitrate and system load is quite high.

The MCP2515 is a very bad design, but the driver performance has improved a lot
since spi-bitbang started using a kthread instead of a work-queue.

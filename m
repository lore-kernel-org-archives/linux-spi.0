SH7757 has RSPI Control Register 2 and the TX only mode flag, while
RSPI-RZ (and QSPI) haven't.
The number of interrupts also differ, but that's easily handled via
the interrupts
property.

BTW, I also don't have the SH7757 datasheet (will check), so my knowledge
there is purely based on the behavior of the code.

Oops, yes, sorry about that.

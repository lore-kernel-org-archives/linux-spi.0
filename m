Since mmap interface is used only by mtd flash drivers and since almost
all mtd flash devices use synchronous transfers (spi_sync()), IMO, there
wont be out of order problem wrt mtd flashes.
But mmap read might delay transfers queued for non mtd flash devices. It
is difficult to wait for all transfers already queued to be pumped out
by __spi_pump_messages() and then do the mmap transfer. Do you have any
thoughts on how to sync with message queue?

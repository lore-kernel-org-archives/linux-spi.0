Sorry for a late answer.

I've been trying to address these goals,
but since the pl022 message queueing, interrupt handling and
most everything is based on using struct spi_message and since
all message transfer helpers (such as spi_write_then_read()) take
an struct spi_device * as argument, and at some point using the
internal functions from the outside with struct spi_message involves
setting the .spi field of the message to something, so obviously that
would fall back to the old solution.

This makes it necessary to refactor the entire driver and queueing
mechanism to take some wrapper message derived from the
spi_message that can work on loops without ever using
struct spi_message by having some .is_loop bool or so.

That's a little much overhead for just adding some hardware tests
and breaks the design pattern from the rest of the SPI drivers...

Isn't it easier to just say that any tests *must* be done from
userspace, leading to the logical conclusion:

No problem with that. But as clarified in the earlier discussion
with Ben, this is not possible if there are no devices attached to
the bus. This is often the case when you want to exercise some
bare hardware where there is no actual SPI device attached to
the bus. And since the idea was to use the loopback (i.e. not
communicating with any actual device) this leads to the addition
of a dummychip for loopback tests anyway.

I'll assume this latter approach is what is really desired and cook
up a patch for that (just a Kconfig for adding the dummychip, no
debugfs intrinsic tests) for the moment.

The patch as it stands (and works today on the U300
dummychip) is just the latter solution with an in-kernel
exerciser.

Yours,
Linus Walleij

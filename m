Hi Christian,

Thanks for taking time to review the driver. Please see my answers inli=

My 3110 driver started to work in 2008(surely very basic at that time) =
before
your driver is posted on public. And the reasons I still posted driver =

1. It provides a console
2. It use buffer read/write to meet our performance goal, max3110 doesn=

If we can cooperate to make current 3100 driver meet our expectation, I=

posting 6 or more versions of code :)

It's not me push it too much, but I was pushed too much :)
We can't make the decision how the HW is used on all kinds of platforms=
=2E For
ours, we heavily rely on it as a sole console, and basic requirement is=
:
the datasheet say it supports 230400~300 baud rate, then driver guy nee=
d make
it work as it claims, like copying 500 bytes string somewhere and paste=
 it on
this console in 230400/600 rate.

=46or the kernel early boot phase debug, I actually had another 3110
early_printk patch which can work right after the kernel starts

Can't agree more, all I want is just a upstream driver which meets the =
basic
requirement.

Yes, checking T bit is a good idea for single word transfer model, but =
it
doesn't help when using buffer read/write

Yes, like Grant and others have mentioned, I plan to use spi->irq as th=
e
condition, platform code which initialize the board_info should clear t=
he
irq to 0 if they won't use IRQ for 3110

	if (spi->irq)
		request_irq(spi->irq,...);
	else
		start_read_thread;

Overkill is just the word I have used when replying comments on my
earlier version :)

I didn't use kmalloc/kfree in my earlier submission, but other develope=
rs
mentioned the buffer allocated here need be DMA safe, as 3110 may work
with many kinds of SPI controller, some of them only supports DMA mode.

The function is called only in driver's own main thread and reader thre=
ad
context, 512 should be safe enough. Also the reason I don't use
kzalloc/kfree is the same as you mentioned: performance

Why this can't work? the test/set_bit are atomic operations. This bit
check is not exclusive, it just try to save some waking up, though waki=
ng a
already running thread doesn't cost too much as mentioned by Andrew

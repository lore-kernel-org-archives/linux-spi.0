The problem is that CONFIG_ACPI_INITRD_TABLE_OVERRIDE is presented as
a debug option in Documentation/initrd_table_override.txt and most
distributions are not selecting it which makes it hard to use it in
practice.

The implementation will stay the same of course, I was just suggesting
to move CONFIG_ACPI_INITRD_TABLE_OVERRIDE in
acpi_os_physical_table_override to allow new tables to be loaded even
if the option is not selected.

Hrm to have pdev pointer instead of the devname string? In the core we =
could
get the pdev from the caller's device with to_platform_device(dev) and =
simply
compare the pointers...

One of the issue I see (in mach-davinci and mach-omap1/2) is that the p=
devs
are scattered around in the c files so gathering the pointers to a plac=
e where
we can see them to be able to use it in the dma_filter_map is not going=
 to be
light weight task.
=46urthermore we have the omap_hwmod for OMAP2+ which creates the actua=
l pdevs
and resources from the omap_hwmod data structures so getting out the DM=
A event
numbers there is not going to be easy either...

I'll hold back the RFC v3 to see if we should switch to pdev pointer or=
 stay
with the devname strings here.

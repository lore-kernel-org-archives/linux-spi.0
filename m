Remember that we can at least in theory have additional chip selects
that aren't controlled by the IP block but are instead GPIOs.  There's
also some potential confusion for users between the number of chip
selects in use in a given system and the size of the bitfield that the
driver needs to take care of.

I don't think it has any value.

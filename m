No, this won't work without any changes to the Armada dtsi /
dts files. As the SPI controller node needs to get moved
for this 'reg' property to work (suggestion from Arnd).

I've submitted 2 patches for the dtsi / dts files a short while
ago:

http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg495524.html
http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg495523.html

When this SPI driver patch gets accepted, I'll send an updated
patchset for the dtsi / dts files.

Correct. We're using this SPI bus on this "SPI device" for FPGA
programming only. This can be done multiple times though. Currently
there is no way to switch operation modes at runtime. I'm not sure
if this is really needed. Either a device supports this mode or
it doesn't.

Yes. Please see above, as I don't know if this is really needed
in practice.

Thanks,
Stefan

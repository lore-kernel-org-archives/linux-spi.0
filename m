Magnus, could you Ack these or otherwise?

Above I see v2, v3, v4 and v5 patches.

While I can make sense of this it makes it cumbersome to refer to the
series as a whole.

Bob, can you take a look at '"[PATCH 00/11] ARM: shmobile: RSPI RZ and
QSPI SoC and board", posted on Tuesday the 2nd, which includes v2, v3,
v4 and v5 patches'?

What would make my life easier would be if the entire series was v5 and
all the patches contained in it were v5. Then I could just ask Bob to look
at "[PATCH v5 00/11] ARM: shmobile: RSPI RZ and QSPI SoC and board"

There is no Bob but I do ask people these kind of questions :)

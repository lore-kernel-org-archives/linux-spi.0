It's the same situation we had with the QSPI driver before. We decided 
to **not** pass information about flash size directly to the controller 
for now. That's why we currently don't support mapping the flash device 
in the implementation of the QSPI driver.

I think we should not start this discussion all over again for the 
FlexSPI driver, but stick to what we decided for QSPI.

I guess Boris meant to link to his PoC implementation of the direct 
mapping API [1]. When this is available we can easily add support for 
direct memory mappings to the QuadSPI and FlexSPI drivers.

Yes you posted your changes to make the driver work for your board. The 
problem is, that I don't yet understand why they are needed and how they 
actually fix the chip select issue.

Han has pointed out the reason why ioremap() was added to the driver [2] 
in the first place and this seems unrelated to the CS selection issue.

Therefore Boris and I have requested more information about how the IP 
works and more tests from other people.

As long as we don't get more information about the questions posted 
before [3][4], we are kind of blocked.

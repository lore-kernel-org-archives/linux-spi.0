The only important difference I can see (beside the hardcoded 16-bit width 
which could be selected as the default) is that the SSH7757 RSPI has no SPL 
bits in SPDCR. I don't have access tot he SH7757 datasheet, could you please 
confirm that ?

Don't you mean "renesas,qspi-r8a7790" and "renesas,qspi-r8a7791" ?

What difference would that make?  The caller is sending a single SPI
operation and this is a user visible thing...

So if you're doing this you may have a good reason to implement
transfer_one_message() instead.  Or perhaps implement it in the core and
provide operations to do the map and unmap.  And of course if this sort
of requirement exists that's an obvious thing that must be documented
in the interfaces but isn't.

We need a lot more thought about the interface here, the lack of any
explanation of what the interface is supposed to be and the fact that
all questions about it are being answered in terms of describing the
specific system are both a bit worrying.

That sounds awful.

It begs the question, what are you saving/improving by using this
framework then?

As I've said before, the framework you're suggesting is likely to aid
a Controller which shares a great deal of functionality with the
m25p80 where the back-end controller driver doesn't use the SPI
Subsystem. That won't apply to some Serial Flash Controller drivers,
ours included.

The idea of providing a framework like this is to reduce unnecessary
duplication of code by consolidating shared routines into a central
point. mp25p80 is a good place for that, as a great many Controllers
share the majority of its code. As the only commonality we have with
the m25p80 is a small piece of the JEDEC extraction and a sub-section
of the supported device table (which A. our Controller doesn't support
all of the devices and C. we've extended the table to make it more
useful for our use-case); what you're suggesting would not only
create a larger code-base, but execution would also take more cycles,
which to me sounds completely counter-intuitive. It's lose-lose!

Using the m25p80 as a pass-through, then creating an OPCODE based
switch statement to then go and do the _real_ work sound absurd.

I agree.

It's 'workable', but not efficient. I wrote that example to show you
how bad it would look and to show that is was not a good idea, not
as a good example to be followed.

> If you do not like the read_reg() hook, do you have any better idea?

I don't have a better idea. I think your framework will work just fine
for some controllers. I just don't think bending ours to use it (by
basically adding _extra_ code, and subsequently extra cycles) is the
best way to go.

Kind regards,
Lee

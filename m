Between this, reading through the other comments, and the existence of
the max3100 driver, I'm less and less comfortable with this driver.
=46irst, if this driver gets merged, then it is quite likely that
neither you or the 3100 author will get around to merging them.
Second, as others have pointed out, this driver is making assumptions
about the SPI bus that it has no business making.  The fact that it
doesn't work with DMA isn't a design choice, it is a bug and whether
or not it is a low speed uart device is completely beside the point.

I'm generally not involved with the serial device drivers, but FWIW,
I'm no longer in favor of this driver getting merged.  If you really
want to get it merged, then I recommend asking Greg to pick it up into
staging so that there is some imperative to fix it up and merge it
with the max3100 driver.

We can add an additional check for dev_fwnode(dev->parent) if match
for dev_fwnode(dev) fails in match_fwnode callback. Please correct me
if I am wrong. But then, we will be doing these two comparisons for
each device (until a match is found) on a bus for a bus_find_device
iteration(mostly unnecessarily because I could not find any "match
node" callbacks (for bus_find_device) currently doing this). So,
wouldn't it be better to add this check in exceptional cases (like in
the case of I2C) in the respective subsystems itself ?

Thanks,
Silesh

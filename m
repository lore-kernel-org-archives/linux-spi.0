Your comment has nothing to do with my response.  Are you implying that
your suggestions do *NOT* introduce complexity, including new failure
modes and thus the possibility of new confusing types of bugs?

That kind of heuristic is something the SPI controller driver could
already apply if it's a good tradeoff on that hardware.  (Considering
also the extra added complexity, failure modes, and potential for new
flavors of bug...)

Of course, drivers like the max3110 are high enough in the driver
stack that they can only guess about such tradeoffs.  (And thus
most drivers will likely guess wrong...)

If someone decided to update a SPI controller driver to avoid DMA in
some cases, in favor of PIO, they could already code such heuristics
without needing your proposed hinting from upper layers.

The result in the low-level driver would be just to use a different
test (maybe "is this a one-word transfer?" instead of checking your
per-transfer "use PIO?" hint) before kicking in whatever logic you
think would improve performance (by eliminating DMA setup and teardown
costs, including cache cleaning).

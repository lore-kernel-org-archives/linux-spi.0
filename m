    I'm not dreaming anything up. Please understand that CPPI 4.1 is not just 
a normal DMA controller -- it's a complex of several devices with DMA 
controller being only one of them, and one that can't work autonomously but 
only thru the proxy of the queue manager. That queue manager stuff I found 
hard to fit into drivers/dma/ infrastructure. Myabe it was a honest mistake, 
of course.

    Some details have slipped rom my memory after that many years. Im sorry 
for that.

    DaVinci is also being converted to device tree. However, that support 
remains optional for now. Not sure it will make things easier, as we still 
have two distinct devices to declare in the device tree: DMA controller and 
queue manager, and we'll have to describe the interconnect between them too 
(as a props of DMA controller I guess)...

WBR, Sergei

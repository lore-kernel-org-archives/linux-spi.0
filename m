I believe Greg wouldn't see that as a positive point.

Don't think that the platform bus _should_ always be used.  It shouldn't
(Greg has said he'd like to see the platform bus to be totally killed off.)
Instead, custom buses properly suited to the class of device in question
is much preferred, especially if it aids in...

... better layering or separation of drivers.

So, thinking that converting from a custom bus to a platform bus
definitely is /not/ a positive step forward.

(Why mfd was ever allowed to re-use the platform bus stuff is a separate
question not relevent to these patches.)

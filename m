Hi,

resending the patchset as I missed some recipients on the first round.

This patchset has the purpose of adding support for the regulator framework to 
the mmc_spi driver. The first three patches are preparatory cleanups to make 
the forth one more straightforward.

Maybe the fourth patch can be improved, I am open to any suggestions about it.

These changes take strong inspiration from the pxamci driver; they have been 
tested on a Motorola A910, which uses a regulator to powerup the MMC card 
connected to the SPI bus, a test from a current user of the mmc_spi driver 
would not hurt just to be sure no regressions have been introduced.

Thanks,
   Antonio

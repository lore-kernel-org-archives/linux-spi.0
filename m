So if you're trying to do this you need to document it adequately so
that other people can understand what it is supposed to do and how to
use and implement it.  People can't really tell how the interface is
supposed to work based on what was in the patch and the above isn't
really helping.  For example, how does this change or restrict what the
contents of the spi_message are?

As far as I can tell you want to set a per spi_message flag saying that
the message is a flash read command?  If that's what this is trying to
do then why do you need to set the flag at all?  If the message is in a
clearly defined format and it's more efficient to use this mmap mode
then surely the driver can just recognise that the format is approprate
and switch into mmap mode without being explicitly told - I'm not clear
what the flag adds here.

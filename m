Yes.  The down-side is that you don't have any idea from the higher
levels whether the driver used DMA or PIO, and in the case of PIO,
it's extra work that the CPU ends up doing.

These were introduced for XFS, since it does IO and expects to be
able to see the results via vmalloc space.  Since it's working with
the block layer, the expectation there is that PIO drivers will
always ensure that data read by PIO reaches the point of coherence,
so it can do a cache invalidate after the read in every case without
losing data.

That's not true of SPI, so you need to be extra careful about how
you're using these - I think you can only use flush_kernel_vmap_range()
before writes and flush_kernel_vmap_range() both before and after reads.
You need it before a read to ensure that any dirty cache lines from
the vmalloc mapping won't overwrite the data you're reading via the
non-vmalloc mapping, and the one after caters for any speculatively
prefetching that may have occurred.

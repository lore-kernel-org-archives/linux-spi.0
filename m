We've tried 25MHz and 50MHz.  Both fail in the same way.  Keep in mind this is
definitely a timing / race issue and it probably also dependent on the latency
of the attached device.  I cannot reproduce this at all on my IPQ8064 based
board, but others can.

This problem manifested itself while using spidev and a usermode flash
programming application (flashrom).

No, a better way of putting this is that immediately on setting RUN state,
you'll get a service interrupt to fill the FIFO in block mode.  So there is no
need to prime the FIFO from the non-isr context due to this behavior.

Good point.  I need to be consistent.

Ah I missed the __spi_validate where this is done.  I'll remove this.  Good
catch.

Agreed.

Well I had it collapsed and the functions are identical except for the
read/write specific pieces, which amount to 2 lines.  I can resplit it out.  It
makes it symmetric.

Agreed.

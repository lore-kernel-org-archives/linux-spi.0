Yes, that's a bug ... you're using a programming interface which
has portability as a core goal.  In an operating system kernel
which also has such a goal.

That's the right solution.

Let's not do either of those.  There's no need to introduce such complexity,
or to enable the associated new failure modes and bugs.

Much simpler to just use DMA-safe I/O buffers in the first place ... which is
what pretty much every driver stack in Linux already expects or requires.

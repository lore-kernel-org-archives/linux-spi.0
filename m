The patch

   spi: atmel: fix corrupted data issue on SAM9 family SoCs

has been applied to the spi tree at

   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/spi.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] spi: atmel: fix corrupted data issue on SAM9 family SoCs

This patch disables the use of the DMA for data transfer and forces the
use of PIO transfers instead as a quick fixup to solve the cache aliasing
issue on ARM9 based cores, which embeds a VIVT data cache.

Indeed in the case of VIVT data caches, it is not safe to call dma_map_*()
functions to map buffers for DMA transfers when those buffers have been
allocated by vmalloc() or from any DMA-unsafe area.

Further patches may propose a better solution based on the use of a bounce
buffer at the SPI sub-system level but such solution needs more time to be
discussed. Then the use of DMA transfers could be enabled again to improve
the performances but before that, this patch already solves the issue.

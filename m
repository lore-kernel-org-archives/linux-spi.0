I think that during the initial enumeration the controller driver's
probe walks the children and creates device objects for them.  When a
table is loaded later, the controller driver has been probed already
and there needs to be a way to trigger a walk over the (new) children
from it.

Or a hook somewhere around acpi_platform_notify() is needed.

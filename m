I tried to push a patch handling the VIVT cache flush in the daVinci  SPI d=
river, but this was NACK'ed. So, in general terms, the upper layers do not =
know if the SPI controller will correctly handle vmalloc'ed buffers.

I can reproduce the VIVT cache bug with 100% reliability either using spi-l=
oopback-test (with patches) or mounting/reading/writing to a UBIFS volume. =
The physical address of the vmalloc'ed buffers is mapped to both vmap and l=
owmem virtual address, and when doing DMA, only the lowmem virtual address =
is used when invalidating/flushing the cache.

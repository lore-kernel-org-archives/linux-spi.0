    I looked back at the history of CPPI 4.1 driver related threads, and found 
that Kevin Hilman gas suggested it too while the driver was in mach-davinci/ 
still...

    Right, I tried to fit it (in my thought only though) in and it didn't work 
out.

    Well, actually before doing this too...

    No, it was someone from TI.

    Moving it to drivers/usb/ is probably the reason TI has been quite content 
with the situation -- their clients kept receiving MUSB DMA support on both 
OMAP-L1x and then Sitara, so all looked well for them.

    Well, maybe you should have said it one more time for those who were late 
in the game like me.

    Yes, of course, that's clear.

    That's clear. You're the ARM King. :-)

    Here you're not quite correct. TI did not prolongate contgract with MV 
after our releasing the support for OMAP-L137, which is early 2009, AFAIR.

    As you can see, TI didn't feel obliged to do so already.

    Hm... wasn't it David Brownell? He's the only person who I know has died 
recently who has dealt with DaVinci, MUSB and the releated stuff.

Both Frode and you confirmed that the alias issue does occur at least
with VIVT caches, hence we can't rely on spi_map_msg() in that case.
So I agree with you: adding a bounce buffer in spi-nor seems to be a
good solution at least till some rework is done in the ubifs layer, as
proposed by Boris, to replace vmalloc'ed buffers by kmalloc'ed memory.

However I still think testing spi->master->dma_{tx|rx} only is not
accurate enough to decided whether or not the SNOR_F_USE_BOUNCE_BUFFER
flag should be set. I have doubts about forcing the use of the bounce
buffer for *all* SPI controllers doing DMA transfers.

We already know that the cache aliases issue can't occur with PIPT
caches or some VIPT caches. So in those cases spi_map_buf() is enough,
hence can we justify the performance loss of the copy into the bounce
buffer for people who don't suffer the issue?

Besides, some SPI controller drivers may already use their own bounce
buffer for other reasons. Then for those controllers, it would be one
more copy.

Then I don't whether we should:
1 -  extend in SPI sub-system API to tell us if the SPI controller can
deal with non-kmalloc'd buffer for DMA transfers

or

2 - get the answer at a system-wide level.

Indeed, the question cache aliases is clearly not specific to the MTD or
SPI sub-systems but only the SPI controller driver can tell whether it
already uses its own bounce buffer.

Best regards,

Cyrille

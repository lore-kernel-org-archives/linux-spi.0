True and this is the reason we have controller drivers and protocol drivers.
GQSPI is the controller driver and spi-nor and spi-nand are the
protocol drivers.

Just to clear, dual parallel( 2 CS and 8 IO lines) is not only specific
to flash parts, one can use for any other custom streaming protocols
I would say exporting dual parallel connection to protocol drivers is
something like depicting the spi bus topology to the protocol layer.

AFAIK, spi-nor and spi-nand are protocol drivers for accessing the
nor and nand flash devices sitting on the spi bus using the spi
controller driver.

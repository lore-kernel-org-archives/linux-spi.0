mtdinfo shows I have no mtd devices and the log shows that probe
failed unless I patch the kernel.

When there is *support* for of partitions the ofparser is run on mtd
probe. If it fails because it considers

>>         controller-data {
>>             samsung,spi-feedback-delay = <0>;
>>         };

an invalid partition and does not find any valid partition the probe fails.

There are two problems here

1) the above is not invalid. It just is not a partition. The parser
should not fail seeing this

2) the mtd probe should not fail when a partition parser fails and
should present the unpartitioned device

Both are addressed in separate patches.

Thanks

First patch, adds can_dma() like interface for spi_flash_read()
interface,
this will enable controller drivers to selectively use DMA based on
buffer type, alignment, size or other limitations.
Second patch implements bounce buffer support for ti-qspi driver to
handle buffers that are not DMA'able, like vmalloc'd buffers that belong
to LPAE region. This is required to work with UBIFS.

Vignesh R (2):
  spi: Add can_dma like interface for spi_flash_read
  spi: spi-ti-qspi: Use bounce buffer if read buffer is not DMA'ble

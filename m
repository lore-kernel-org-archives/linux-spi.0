It should work anyway if you are sure you clear the the condition that
generated the interrupt (so the interrupt line will have another
transition for sure). It's quite common when using deferred work
(worqueues for example) otherwise you have to turn irq off to avoid an
interrupt storm. Usually turning interrupts on and off is quite tricky
because they are counted.

huh didn't noticed that it supports only one instance. I guess this is
very bad (my test machine for example has 2 MAX3100s, one for a GPS
receiver and one for a slow RS485 link).

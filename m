Can you please share an example of "cs-gpios" property for a particular
case, which I'm able to test? It is an Atmel AT93C66A EEPROM connected
to CSPI1 and sitting on chip select 2 (= selected by CSPI1_SS2), there
is no other SPI devices on CSPI1.

Since I raise the question, please add the correspondent updates and
and an example to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/fsl-imx-cspi.txt

In fact my expectation would be to have a device description like one
below:

&spi1 {
	status = "okay";
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_cspi1>;

	eeprom@2 {
		compatible = "atmel,at93c66a";
		reg = <2>;
		spi-cs-high;
		spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
	};
};

Note, that there is no cs-gpios property at all, which is mandatory
at the moment, and unit address / reg property defines chip select
number.

For that type of bindings locally I have a hackish spi-imx driver change,
which supports this option, but I'm unsure if it is universal enough.

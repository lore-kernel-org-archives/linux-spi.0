Well, I based my patches on linux-next as per Brian's suggestion. If
patches to support other flash protocol modes are accepted, I would be
happy to rebase and make use of other modes. It would just be the matte=
r
of populating msg.{opcode/addr}_n_bits correctly.

Above feature can be added incrementally over this series, (as and when
m25p80 is updated) moreover ti-qspi controller does not support
option/mode cycles in memory-mapped mode, so I wont be able to test thi=
s
feature anyway.

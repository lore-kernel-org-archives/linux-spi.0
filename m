That shouldn't be a problem. The IIO API allows different consumers to 
request different channels of a converter. You can write a generic IIO based 
backlight driver and a generic IIO based volume control driver. This makes 
it possible to re-use them in other circuits with other DACs but the same 
application.

If it is a generic DAC it should go into drivers/iio/, this will allow code 
sharing and code re-usability. Given the simplicity of the DAC there might 
even be other existing drivers that can be used to control it.

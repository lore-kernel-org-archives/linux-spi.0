Presumably you will do this *before* sending the read command so the
SPI driver can reverse-engineer it according to the spi-nor read
pattern.

Then the mmap mode can be set in spi_sync() but you also have to lock
the spi controller to prevent other transfers from resetting it.

Or you can pass the read buffer to the SPI master driver as well to do
the memcpy for you. Which you want to do anyway in case the SPI master
can use DMA to fill the buffer rather than memcpy.

Presumably when the memcpy ends the transfer is done.

Presumably you have to restore to non-mmap mode only when you receive
a command that requires it. If the next command is read with same
configuration you can just keep reading.

You only need modification to the SPI master driver and m25p80 driver.

The SPI master driver is where the hardware-specific operation is
executed and m25p80 is where you have the information so you can
decide to take advantage of the hardware acceleration.

The spi master driver can track what mode is set on the controller and
change it as needed before each transfer. This is what is commonly
done for other SPI master hardware configuration options.

This is bogus.

Firstly this is per-slave and not per-master.

Secondly in devicetree you have jedec,spi-nor which says exactly that
the SPI slave is a device that responds to the JEDEC identify command.
Nothing more. The data returned from the identify command is used to
determine what the command opcodes are, what features are supported,
etc. So that is *not* in the dt and there is no place for hardwiring
opcodes in the dt.

There is no 'allowed' pattern. Any message like 1~7 bytes long can be
interpreted as read command. Unless you can tell the SPI master driver
it cannot know.

And you go the abominable route of the original patch that you compose
a SPI message in m25p80, and then decide in the SPI master driver that
you will in fact not send a SPI message and reverse-engineer what
m25p80 really meant.

I would just pass these as separate arguments to the function but whatver.

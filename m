Hi Angus,

_nicely_ explained indeed :)

So do I, now I finally get the problem.

I checked the VYBRIDRM.pdf datasheet. I grok down that the thing Vybrid does is 
it has such a lookup table. The table has 16 slots , each can contain up to 8 
SPI NOR instructions . These instructions are programmed when the driver 
probe()s I suppose. To do a communication with the SPI NOR, you give the 
controller an index in this lookup table and it will execute this pre-programmed 
sequence of commands on the SPI NOR.

So yes, your API would work nicely with Vybrid. I agree about read_reg() and 
write_reg() functions, they will be needed for reading the standard CR/SR etc 
registers on the SPI NOR and also SPI NOR specific cruft if need be. As for 
readid(), I wonder if we cannot implement it via some generalized read_reg() 
call, I suspect we can for starters. Same goes for wait_till_read(), let's 
implement it in the spi-nor framework first and only if a piece of hardware can 
speed this up significantly by re-implementing it itself, they will change the 
framework.

The read() and write() calls are nice, something like mmap() might be 
interesting here as well, since based on what Poddar explained, his controller 
can somehow map the SPI flash into the CPU address space. I don't know how this 
should work precisely, but again, this can be left until such controller driver 
hits mainline and the benefits of such implementation would become obvious.

Finally, the erase_sector() call would probably need to be extended. I would 
rename it to simple erase(), since we can erase from sub-sectors (4K) to whole 
chip.

btw. I really like the idea of the new SPI NOR framework. The M25P80 driver 
could then be rewritten and plugged into the SPI NOR framework just like any 
other SPI NOR controller driver with "advanced capabilities".

Talking about read-write-erase, why don't we -- instead of passing buffer -- 
pass a scatterlist ? I suppose that might make it easier for these "advanced" 
controller to do DMA on it.

I'd love to take this on, but I need to flush my pipeline first ;-( Besides, it 
seems we have an abundance of good engineers here already, so maybe someone will 
actually write it ;-)

Full ACK.

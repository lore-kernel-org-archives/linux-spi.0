But I still don't think it's a good idea to use DMA for Max3110 for
performance reason, I know there is some spi controller who only works in
DMA mode. 

Here comes another idea, can we add a capability flag in struct spi_master
indicating the master supporting poll or dma or both. Also we add similar
bits in struct spi_transfer indicating the this transfer wants to be handled
in poll or dma mode. For spi controller driver, it can claim its
capability when registering as a spi_master, for a spi device driver, it can
select the working mode based on spi_master's capability and set the working
mode in struct spi_transfer. Then controller and device don't need to guess
what the other is capable, and make the info public. Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Feng

You're abusing the speed_hz setting of the SPI controller.  By
clocking down the SPI bus, you're effectively using the SPI completion
interrupt as a high resolution timer to schedule your character
transmissions so that you don't overrun the max3110 which has no tx
fifo.  Using a udelay is also the wrong thing to do because it chews
up CPU cycles to achieve the same result.

The correct thing to do is to either use a high resolution timer, or
the IRQ from the MAX3110 itself to schedule your spi transfers, and
set the SPI rate to the highest frequency that the MAX3110 can handle
so that your driver neither hogs the SPI bus, nor wastes CPU cycles.
You can improve the performance of the driver by using spi_async()
instead of spi_sync() it enqueue the transfers so that you can handle
everything at IRQ context and you don't need to drop into a workqueue
to process the data.

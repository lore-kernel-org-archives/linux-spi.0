Hi Gregory,

Patch does not apply, but I cannot immediately isolate the damage.
Please see if you can figure out the issue on your end.  Is it your
mailer?  I could fudge it, but in the long run it is better if this
issue can get sorted out now.

Also, a few other minor nitpicks (I won't reject a patch over these,
but it helps to have them right):

Please prefix spi patch names with "spi[/driver]:".  It is the format
for all spi patches I take through my tree, and if it already follows
that convention, then I don't need to edit it manually.

Second, please keep the line length in the patch description short; in
general I find that a textwidth limit of 70 characters is about right
for the purpose of reading/replying in email.  A lot of maintainers
use text email clients like mutt in 80 column terminal windows.
Keeping a reasonable right hand margin in the text body is simply
friendly.

Finally, in changelogs it is easier to read if there is some kind of
itemization ticks.  For example:

* Change from v5 to v6:
  - Rebase on linus/master (after 2.6.37-rc7)
  - Use CONFIG_SUSPEND instead of CONFIG_PM
  - Didn't use legacy PM methods anymore. Instead, add a struct
    dev_pm_ops and add the resume method there.
  - Fix multi-line comment style

    I don't remember that, probably was out of the loop again.

    I remember this as a discussion happening post me sending the patch to the 
patch system and it being discarded...

    Probably was me. There was also idea of putting it into drivers/usb/musb/ 
-- which TI indeed followed in its Arago prject. I firmly denied that suggestion.

    But there *are* drivers there! And look at edma.c which is about to be 
moved there... Anyway, I haven't seen such warnings, probably was too late in 
the game.

    Well, as usual... :-(

    Thanks, I remember this variant was under arch/arm/common/.
    Now however, I see what happened to that variant in somewhat different 
light. Looks like it was entirely your decision to discard the patch, without 
TI's request...

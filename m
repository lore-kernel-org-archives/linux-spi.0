Will refer to that documentation and update the SPI docs before resubmi=
tting.

Re; Threshold of 160 is artificial: Believe me, I am more than aware
of this. SPI runs in any speed from low kHz to multi MHz. The only
reason I can fathom for having such a high DMA_MIN_BYTES is to
facilitate high-speed low-volume communication (eg read one byte at a
time from userspace without buffering.) The reason I'm looking at this
at all is because we're doing low-speed low-volume communication, for
which the burn in PIO mode causes severe performance degradation.
Internally we'd changed it to 20, but I might try 8. I originally
tried 0, but observed poor behavior for our use cases. DMA_MIN_BYTES
at 8 would be sensible for our application, but at 160 it is not.

The current solution is for everybody who needs to change their device
settings to churn that macro, just as 8b66c1474e16 did. Changing that
values incurs significant risk of excess CPU load (if increased) or
timing slop (if decreased) to all hardware using the McSPI. Moving the
param to DT allows those of us working on custom boards to modify the
value for some hardware without risking the entire ecosystem. Let's
please not keep a bad solution just because no perfect solution
exists...

I think the proper location for this patch might actually be in the
spidev nodes in DT, rather than at the mcspi level - but I don't
understand why this does not belong in DT. DT is, after all, where one
would normally describe the rest of the slave device bindings. A
sensible value for DMA_MIN_BYTES requires the user to know the CPU
clock speed alongside the SPI bus speed, and estimate acceptable
levels of slop in timing. I don't think userspace should need to do
these computations to avoid excess CPU load; could do it in kernel
space, or leave it up to DT or kernel parameters.

How about moving the speed to the spidev DT nodes?

Regards,
Greg

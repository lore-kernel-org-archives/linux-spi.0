Hi,

Are you using the first or second version of the patch? if the former, please 
use v2 (sent a few days later), which has solved the same problem by using a 
mutex instead of allocating message data on stack (which is not good for DMA)

as for the backstory, this crash ocurrs when a short (measured in time spent) 
message was enqueued after a long message, so that the short one finished first 
(the actual bug was present even if the long one finished first, but in that 
case there was double complete() on the one completion instead of a NULL 
dereference)

Pavel

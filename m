Hi,

Our platform is Intel Moorestown platform, and use a spi controller cor=
e
from Designware (drivers/spi/dw_*.c). I know the problem may probably b=
e
caused by my setting, but the dw_spi driver works fine with our own
3110 driver.

=46or debug method, sadly I don't get another output port yet, but if y=
ou
have some debug patch, that's great, it will help when I find another d=
ebug
output than max3110.

It's difficult but not impossible, actually our driver checks every wor=
d
read back and handle it if it contains a valid data

yeah, you hit the point that our spi controller is LSB naturally (not
configured to), here may need a check for whether to do a swap

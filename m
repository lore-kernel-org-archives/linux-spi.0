Right, but that doesn't mean that the requirements put on the
regulator and genpd are gone as well and that is why I favor the OPP
core to handle all the parts otherwise write the rules explicitly. If
the OPP core doesn't disable the clock and the caller also hasn't done
the same, then disabling the genpd/regulator may break things up.

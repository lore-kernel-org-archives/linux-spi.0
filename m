Hi,

tx_empty isn't that easy to implement if there is no way to get the
tx-empty status from the uart, like with the MAX3100. There are several
serial drivers that simply return TIOCSER_TEMT. I know it's really bad
for applications like RS485...
For this reason, and due to the lack of large of tx/rx fifos in the
MAX3100, I'm using Atmel AVRs where you can easily implement larger
fifos and reliable HW flow control in the firmware. Besides, the cost is
just a fraction of the MAX3100.

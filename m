We could do that, with some complexity, but I am not sure if it is
worth it - see below. And in either case I still don't see how we can
avoid two enumeration paths: one from the probe of the controller ->
spi_register_master() -> acpi_register_spi_devices()  and one from the
notification handler -> acpi_register_spi_devices(). Both will end up
are calling the same enumeration function but there are still two
paths.

Even right now, in the case of dynamic DT, we have the two enumeration paths.

If we really want to have a single path for ACPI enumeration we could
do that by using an ACPI SPI bridge driver or scan handlers after
extending the matching mechanisms. But we would still need to modify
the SPI subsystem and I don't think its worth it just to save a call
to acpi_register_spi_devices() from spi_register_master().

Now for parent notification complexity: in the case of SPI we can
easily to this because current ACPI SPI enumeration supports only
direct children as slaves. However, on I2C we can have an unrelated
node as a slave - that is why the I2C scanning searches the whole
namespaces for references to a particular i2c_adapter. So, we would
need to retrieve the parent node from the namespace node information
which means that we will do SPI specific stuff in ACPI generic code. I
don't think it is a big issue, because we already treat SPI / I2C
special, right?

Once we have the parent handle we would still have to iterate through
all controllers to get the spi_master matching the ACPI handle. It is
a bit more efficient then global notification, but probably won't
matter in practice.

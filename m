The patch

   dt-bindings: spi: convert rockchip spi bindings to yaml

has been applied to the spi tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/spi.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: spi: convert rockchip spi bindings to yaml

Current dts files with 'spi' nodes are manually verified.
In order to automate this process spi-rockchip.txt
has to be converted to yaml. In the new setup
spi-rockchip.yaml will inherit properties from
spi-controller.yaml.

Add document to MAINTAINERS.

Also rk3188.dtsi, rk3288.dtsi, rk3368.dtsi and rk3399.dtsi
use an extra fallback string, so change this in the documentation.

Changed:
"rockchip,rk3188-spi", "rockchip,rk3066-spi"
"rockchip,rk3288-spi", "rockchip,rk3066-spi"
"rockchip,rk3368-spi", "rockchip,rk3066-spi"
"rockchip,rk3399-spi", "rockchip,rk3066-spi"

-* Rockchip SPI Controller
-
-The Rockchip SPI controller is used to interface with various devices such as flash
-and display controllers using the SPI communication interface.
-
-Required Properties:
-
-- compatible: should be one of the following.
-    "rockchip,rv1108-spi" for rv1108 SoCs.
-    "rockchip,px30-spi", "rockchip,rk3066-spi" for px30 SoCs.
-    "rockchip,rk3036-spi" for rk3036 SoCS.
-    "rockchip,rk3066-spi" for rk3066 SoCs.
-    "rockchip,rk3188-spi" for rk3188 SoCs.
-    "rockchip,rk3228-spi" for rk3228 SoCS.
-    "rockchip,rk3288-spi" for rk3288 SoCs.
-    "rockchip,rk3368-spi" for rk3368 SoCs.
-    "rockchip,rk3399-spi" for rk3399 SoCs.
-- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
-       region.
-- interrupts: The interrupt number to the cpu. The interrupt specifier format
-              depends on the interrupt controller.
-- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
-- clock-names: Shall be "spiclk" for the transfer-clock, and "apb_pclk" for
-			   the peripheral clock.
-- #address-cells: should be 1.
-- #size-cells: should be 0.
-
-Optional Properties:
-
-- dmas: DMA specifiers for tx and rx dma. See the DMA client binding,
-		Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt
-- dma-names: DMA request names should include "tx" and "rx" if present.
-- rx-sample-delay-ns: nanoseconds to delay after the SCLK edge before sampling
-		Rx data (may need to be fine tuned for high capacitance lines).
-		No delay (0) by default.
-- pinctrl-names: Names for the pin configuration(s); may be "default" or
-		"sleep", where the "sleep" configuration may describe the state
-		the pins should be in during system suspend. See also
-		pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt.
-
-
-Example:
-
-	spi0: spi@ff110000 {
-		compatible = "rockchip,rk3066-spi";
-		reg = <0xff110000 0x1000>;
-		dmas = <&pdma1 11>, <&pdma1 12>;
-		dma-names = "tx", "rx";
-		rx-sample-delay-ns = <10>;
-		#address-cells = <1>;
-		#size-cells = <0>;
-		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 44 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
-		clocks = <&cru SCLK_SPI0>, <&cru PCLK_SPI0>;
-		clock-names = "spiclk", "apb_pclk";
-		pinctrl-0 = <&spi1_pins>;
-		pinctrl-1 = <&spi1_sleep>;
-		pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
-	};

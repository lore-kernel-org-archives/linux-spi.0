The patch

   spi: atmel: Fix CS high support

has been applied to the spi tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/spi.git for-5.5

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] spi: atmel: Fix CS high support

Until a few years ago, this driver was only used with CS GPIO. The
only exception is CS0 on AT91RM9200 which has to use internal CS. A
limitation of the internal CS is that they don't support CS High.

So by using the CS GPIO the CS high configuration was available except
for the particular case CS0 on RM9200.

When the support for the internal chip-select was added, the check of
the CS high support was not updated. Due to this the driver accepts
this configuration for all the SPI controller v2 (used by all SoCs
excepting the AT91RM9200) whereas the hardware doesn't support it for
infernal CS.

This patch fixes the test to match the hardware capabilities.

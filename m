Ok, so first of all it needs better documentation, also for the
bindings. I will add some.

Second, the driver has "per se" nothing to do with SPI, beside it needs
a clock and data line to transfer an image to the FPGA. (One way,
therefor: passive). It needs to use some SPI controller to do that. Even
the SPI Bitbang driver. Because of this, it depends on the SPI
framework.

Beside the SCLK and MOSI, the protocol needs to toggle and check some
GPIOs for protocol start and end. For that I chose the posix open and
close, so that in userland it can be used as simple as $(cat
firmware.rbf > /dev/psdev0). This protocol also needs no SS line.

It is actually not more than that. I took the spidev character device
driver as reference implementation. Any Idea where to put this driver
instead.

Regards,
Michael

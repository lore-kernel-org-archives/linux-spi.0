OK, that should be more clear in the changelog.  The way I understood
your description, the problem was related to an off-mode transition.

fyi... this part isn't needed.  You're telling the OMAP PM core that
you want the CORE powerdomain to go into off-mode, but you've you've
already done that by the 'enable_off_mode' flag, which enables *all*
powerdomains to hit off mode.

OK, I'd recommend you update the changelog to make that more clear.

Then, I'll leave it to the SPI folks to review your patch.

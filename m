We discussed channel allocation at Linaro.  However, I am now _really_
disappointed.

I discussed this with Linus on the bus back from Cambridge in the evening,
and it appears that the story you gave me was inaccurate - Linus had not
agreed to your proposal and saw more or less the same problems with it
which I've been on at you about via your other email alias/lkml.  So that's
essentially invalidated everything we discussed there as part of my thinking
was "if Linus is happy with it, then...".

I am now convinced that you'll say *anything* just to get your idea into
the kernel.

So, the stakes have now been raised further for you: what I want to see
from you is a _working_ _implementation_ for those three platforms which
I outlined.  I don't want more discussion.  I want patches from you.
Nothing else.  We'll then review the code changes themselves rather than
a vague idea communicated by email/verbally.

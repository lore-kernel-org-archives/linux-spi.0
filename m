Thanks Hemanth,

I'll give it a try with 2.6.29 kernel. Do the patches support McSPI RX interrupt? Or McSPI FIFO full interrupt? Upon receipt of such interrupts, slave client could issue a spi_read.

Thanks

These patches have not been specifically tested on 29 kernel, but you could
give it a shot. Pl also look at the latest patches (V2) posted.

To set any mcspi controller to slave mode, you need to modify
arch/arm/mach-omap2/devices.c file and set mode to OMAP2_MCSPI_SLAVE.

Typically gpio is used by master to notify the slave that it is ready to
transfer data. On gpio interrupt slave client could issue spi_read/spi_write
commands.

Two modes are supported i.e PIO and DMA. Any specific reason not to use DMA
mode.

Thanks

It seems on the i.MX6DL we (additionally) have another issue. I just
tested here on a i.MX6DL board with a NOR Flash connected. I saw the
same issue as I saw on the i.MX6Q, but on the i.MX6DL it cannot be fixed
by using the shp/mcu SDMA scripts.
Funny enough on the i.MX6DL the RXFIFO issue happens much more
frequently than on the i.MX6Q.

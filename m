Both were marked for merging in my inbox, and since I am working
though my (300+) post-vacation emails chronologically v11 was handled
first.

It appears as though there is an issue in the way 'struct
of_device_id' was declared too.  The header file in which it was
declared used to be included by proxy, however a separation has
recently been made causing build errors.

I will fix both issues and re-submit the PR.

Hi Kevin,

This seems to be a common issue for more than just OMAP SoCs, and I've
seen a number of approaches to solving it; both internal to the kernel
(AMBA bus, HWMOD, ad-hoc pdata, etc) and via external data (FDT, SFI).
It doesn't seem like there is a lot of cross-pollination going on
either.

I'm thinking about scheduling a discussion in the embedded
microconference at Plumbers to talk about the encoding and handling of
SoC and machine interconnection data.  There should be enough examples
now that we can agree on some common infrastructure for handling these
kinds of things without inventing new infrastructure from scratch for
each SoC family.  What do you think?

Yes, I like to see refactoring work separated from functional changes
as much as possible.

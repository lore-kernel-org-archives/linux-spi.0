Yes, but still bounce buffer does help in perf improvement over PIO.

Hmm... Yes, there are ways to by pass SPI core.

Yes, this is definitely needed. ->can_dma() currently returns bool. We
need a better interface that returns different error codes for
restriction on buffer length vs buffer type (I dont see any appropriate
error codes) or make ->can_dma() return flag asking for bounce buffer.
SPI controller drivers may use cache_is_*() and virt_addr_valid() to
decide whether or not request bounce buffer.

Again, I guess only SPI controller can suggest the appropriate size of
bounce buffer based on its internal constraints and use cases that its
known to support.

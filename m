Yes, this does seem odd to me too. This looks like an arms race hack
that should be avoided unless we know a legit root cause. Also,
"probe order implies suspend order" doesn't quite work for async suspend
anyway, so we'd probably want to express the dependency properly
anyway.

Any chance this is related? Seems like that might break the parent/child
relationship for master/slave:

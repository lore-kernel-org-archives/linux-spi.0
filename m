The idea was that by using this function we just need one kind of
deferred work (interrupt threads) instead of two (for example
interrupt threads and workqueues) in some situations. This is very
handy with devices that do transmission and reception at the same
time, for example many SPI devices. The user case is the max3100 UART
on SPI driver. The same SPI instruction both receives and sends chars.
So when we need to send a char we just start the interrupt thread
instead of having another kind of deferred work doing the job. This
greatly simplifies locking and avoids duplication of functionality
(otherwise we must have an interrupt thread that does reception and a
workqueue that does sending and receiving for example) because
everything is done in just one point. The move from worqueues to
interrupt threads was motivated by the much smaller latency under load
of the latter because they are scheduled as RT processes. I hope this
doesn't sound like a terrible abuse of threaded interrupts. Let me
know before I try to fix other problems you mentioned.

Thanks

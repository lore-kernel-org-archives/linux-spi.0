Hmmm.. It might have.  I didn't test that before I started hacking...

I still haven't been able to catch this.

I think the interrupt mode is still the better way to go.

I was able to hack your driver to keep the continuous transfer going in a multi-transaction
message.  Unfortunately I don't have an easy way to generate a diff to send the necessary
patch.  The hack does work with the sst25l driver.  It correctly detects the end of the
first 4 byte transfer and immediately chains in the second 2 byte transfer.  It ends up
looking like this:

WWWWwwIRRRRFCRRFi

Where:
  'W' is a write for the current transfer
  'w' is a write for the next transfer
  'I' is the start of the interrupt
  'R' is a read for the current transfer
  'F' is the completion of the current transfer
  'C' is the chain to the next transfer
  'i' is the end of the interrupt

So, at the start of the message the fifo's get primed with the 4+2 of the entire message.
Then interrupts are enabled.  When the interrupt occurs the first 4 byte transfer is read.
When that completes the interrupt routine chains to the next transfer and then reads the
next 2 bytes.  When that completes the message is finished so the interrupts get disabled
and espi->wait is completed.

Unfortunately is seems to break the mmc_spi driver for some reason.  I still haven't
figured out why.

If you can post your latest updates to the v4 driver I will create a patch against it
so others can test this also.

Regards,
Hartley

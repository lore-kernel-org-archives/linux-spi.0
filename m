after some more thoughts while cycling home, would it be sane to implem=
ent it=20
as spi devices like:

lcd-ctrl <->i80_device (spi_device) <->spi-layer <-> i80_spi_master

i80_device would implement the message logic as described below
i80_spi_master would control the registers=20

the write-enable/read-enable bit settings can be determined by the dire=
ction=20
of the transfer, but how do I determine the value to set for RS?

The idea I had was to set bits_per_word to n+1, i.e. the register has 1=
8 data=20
bits and I would use the 19th bit do transmit the required RS setting.

Does this look at least halfway plausible?

Thanks
Heiko

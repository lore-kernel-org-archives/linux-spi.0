Hello,

this does not quite work.

My test with spidev:

# ./spinor /dev/spidev1.0
Sending 9f 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
Received 00 ff c8 60 16 c8 60 16 c8 60 16 c8 60 16 c8 60
Sending 90 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
Received 00 ff ff ff ff c8 15 c8 15 c8 15 c8 15 c8 15 c8
Sending 9f 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
Received 00 ff c8 60 16 c8 60 16 c8 60 16 c8 60 16 c8 60

I receive correct ID but spi-nor complains it does not know ID 00 c8 60.
IIRC garbage should be sent only at the time command is transferred so
only one byte of garbage should be received. Also the garbage tends to
be the last state of the data output - all 0 or all 1.
So it seems using DMA for all transfers including 1-byte commands
results in (some?) received data getting an extra 00 prefix.

[ adding Cc: to devicetree; make sure to keep 'binding' in the
  subject line upon re-submission, such that reviewers can tell
  whether you introduce a new binding, or just use an existing
  binding and implement it in a dts/dtsi file ]

Those "fsl,*" properties somehow feel strange.  I comment on
details below the example since this should even better show why
I feel so.

The number of chips connected to the controller should reflect in
the child nodes of the SPI NOR controller, and need not get
specified in redundant ways and with potential for errors when
they can get determined at runtime.

The capacity of the flash chip as well as the maximum frequency
which the flash chip operates at should be features of the flash
chip (in combination with the board), i.e. of the child node and
not the controller.  SPI slaves already have a documented
property for the purpose of limiting transfer rates when they are
lower than the controller's i.e. busses capabilities.  Can't tell
from the top of my head whether there is a property for the
maximum frequency which a controller should use across the whole
bus.  In any case, either the property needs to get moved, or the
description should get updated to say "the max frequency at which
the controller will send data" or something.

The capacity of the flash chip should be a consequence of either
having gathered CFI information (if available) or having
identified the chip by its JEDEC ID and looked up its features in
an internal database.  Users should not need to specify the
capacity of the flash chip in the device tree.


If the 'fsl,nor-size' property remains (which I doubt at the
moment), you cannot describe "the size of each" chip in one
single-cell spec.  So the documentation should get extended to
reflect multi-chip setups.  But I'd rather assume that the
property is not needed at all.

You can omit the 'status = "okay"' line since that is the default
already in the absence of the keyword.  This property is most
useful to declare yet not enable by default components in .dtsi
files and to do enable them in individual board files if
applicable.  This aspect need not be shown in the binding example
of a QSPI controller.

I'd suggest to use symbolic names for the flags in the last
interrupt specifier cell, as you do for clock items.

And while I'm in nitpick mode :) let me say that I dislike the
blanking around the colons in the properties discussion, but I'm
as well aware that these are "inspired by" the early OF/DT
documents.  There may be as many expectations about formatting of
a document as there are readers/consumers.

Are the following modifications reasonable?

So which is better to describe DT binding for rockchip spi driver as follow:

1. Only add "rockchip,rk3066-spi" for all rockchip socs:
In Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-rockchip.txt
- compatible: should be one of the following.
    "rockchip,rk3066-spi" for rk3066 and following.

In drivers/spi/spi-rockchip.c
static const struct of_device_id rockchip_spi_dt_match[] = {
        { .compatible = "rockchip,rk3066-spi", },
        { },
};
------
2. Add "rockchip,rk3066-spi", "rockchip,rk3066-spi", "rockchip,rk3066-spi" for each soc:

In Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-rockchip.txt
- compatible: should be one of the following.
    "rockchip,rk3066-spi" for rk3066.
    "rockchip,rk3188-spi", "rockchip,rk3066-spi" for rk3188.
    "rockchip,rk3288-spi", "rockchip,rk3066-spi" for rk3288.

In drivers/spi/spi-rockchip.c
static const struct of_device_id rockchip_spi_dt_match[] = {
        { .compatible = "rockchip,rk3066-spi", },
        { .compatible = "rockchip,rk3188-spi", },
        { .compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-spi", },
        { },
};

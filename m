The reason the ads7846 code uses 8-bit messaging
is portability ... it works with SPI controllers
which don't support 16-bit words.  The commands are
of necessity 16-bits.  Using 16-bit words means this
driver won't run on as many systems; folk will still
need to use the ads7846 driver with tsc2046 chips..

Another reason not to have a separate driver: this
one is less capable (as well as less portable)

Something the ads7846 driver could benefit from
too ... again, two drivers is counterproductive.

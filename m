Right. It is of course possible to use this direct mode to access
SPI flash. Its just not the way how the SPI MTD driver uses the
SPI controller. All information that is written to the SPI flash
(e.g. commands, addresses) are passed as plain tx-data in the SPI
message to the SPI controller. And it would be not easy to detect
commands / addresses vs. "real data" in this orion SPI driver
to put these values into the specific registers.

Correct. And this is exactly why I'm using this direct write mode
for the FPGAs connected via SPI. To implement normal, optimized SPI
writes using this direct write mode.

Yes. But I hope my explanation above makes it clear that this is not
easily implemented. So I suggest to just use the implementation I've
added with this patch for these special SPI devices like FPGAs
for fast bitstream downloading. And for this it is necessary, to make
this direct access mode optionally configurable on a per-SPI-device
basis.

Thanks,
Stefan

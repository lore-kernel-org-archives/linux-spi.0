I had a look at the dw_spi driver. The spi_transfer path queues some
work to a worqueue that itself schedules a tasklet. I don't think this
is good for latency, I won't bet that such an architecture could
deliver good performance. Now I see why you needed to do only big fat
SPI transfers. Anyway this doesn't justify the 2 seconds delay between
chars coming in and going out through the max31x0 you are seeing. I
will try to analyze what's going on. BTW is only input slow or output
is sluggish too? The initial messages from the console are coming out
fast? If you disable the MAX3110 for console but you use just as a
normal terminal (set console=/dev/null in the kernel command line and
add getty 115200 /dev/ttyMAX0 in iniitab) is the interaction with the
system fine? Thanks for helping sorting out this.

Of course it is possible, I just wanted to keep the max3100 a small
clean driver. Unfortunately console and serial drivers are two
different beings in the Linux kernel, but the max3100 implements the
tx-rx in one indivisible instruction (that is slow compared to
registers IO and has to be called in an preemptible contex for added
fun).  To implement what you are saying we need:

1) the console code has to check if the serial port associated to the
same physical max3100 is up (console driver start their life much
before serial ones).

2) if yes send data to the tty associated to the serial driver.
Locking is needed here.

I will implement this ASAP.

ok, I think the dw_spi driver has to be fixed.

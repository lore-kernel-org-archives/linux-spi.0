Okay, thanks.

Hemanth, I'm going to drop this series for the moment.  I'd like to
see some feedback/acks from current users and maintainers of the
omap2_mcspi driver before I merge support, especially now when the
merge window is about to open and it hasn't gotten any linux-next
exposure.

Right, I agree.  I'll ignore patch 3 entirely until I at least see a
patch for an in-tree user.

Thanks,

SPI is synchronous transfer so it does not need a large FIFO. If DMA is
not able to replenish the TX shift register, the master should hold the
clock until the time it is ready with data. On the scope do you see
master continuing to pulse the clock while it is waiting for data to
arrive from DMA to its TX shift register ? That should not be happening.

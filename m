No thanks, I've only looked at them briefly.

Up to you to decide. But here's my experience so far..

Based on my experience if temporary hacks are merged, then nobody
bothers to clean them up properly afterwards and the clean-up task
unfairly falls on the maintainer.

So IMHO, hacks like that are better floating on the mailing list
until they're properly done. It's best to concentrate on getting
the core things done right to make long term support easier.

Tony

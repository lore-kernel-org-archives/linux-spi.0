Hi,

I just answer to this last message as it seems that continuous
transfer is really not a 100% solid solution; It makes things more
complicated than need to be and benefit for that is probably not
worth the additional complexity. Feel free to disagree :)

For the MMC over SPI at least we really cannot ever make fully
compliant solution with SFRMOUT because, during init phase protocol
sends CMD0 (reset) with chipselect active high (SPI_CS_HIGH). This
forces SD/MMC card to SPI mode. However, many cards seem to work
without any chipselect logic at all (with Sim.One for example).

Do we all agree that we can live with GPIOs as chipselect? Or do
we continue investigation to make it work with boards that use
SFRMOUT as CS?

I have following plans for v5 (in case we don't care about SFRMOUT).
Before doing the changes I would like to hear your opinnion.

	- prime the FIFO first in every transfer (Hartley's suggestion)
	- address review comments for v4
	- add Martin's patch for clearing SSPICR only if we get ROR
	- add necessary documentation under Documentation/spi/ep93xx_spi.txt

Thanks,
MW

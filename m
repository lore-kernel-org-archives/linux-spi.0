AFAICT, the Mediatek SPI does not have a 33-bit mode.  The Mediatek
SPI DMA registers are only 32-bits wide, so the default 0xffffffff
dma_mask is correct.  For larger addresses, swiotlb properly falls
back to using a bounce buffer.

However, I did discover what the real problem was.  The Mediatek SPI
DMA does not like un-aligned addresses.
Teaching the driver to use the FIFO even for large buffers, and
forcing un-aligned buffers to use the FIFO makes the SPI very
reliable:

Thanks for your help!

Yes, it's basically an optimization problem: the closer you can squeeze
everything together, the more address space you have left for RAM and/or
PCI.

>From the Armada XP data sheet, I can also see that it's possible to map
multiple SPI slaves into the MMIO space using a single MBus window, which
can be useful if  you have plenty of address space but a shortage of
mbus window registers.

I've looked up the original patch now, and I agree with your concern.
It's not at all what I suggest here though. We should not need any
properties in the spi slave node, and I think all added properties in
the spi master node should be static, and not refer to the configuration
at all.

In the DT node for the spi master, we already have a register range
for the SPI's control registers, and this is an address in the
domain of the MBus controller, which we treat as a 64-bit flat address
space in DT, specifically it is part of the 'internal-regs' bus that
has a 20-bit section out of that 64-bit bus:

        soc {
                #address-cells = <2>;
                #size-cells = <1>;
                internal-regs {
                        compatible = "simple-bus";
                        #address-cells = <1>;
                        #size-cells = <1>;
                        ranges = <0 MBUS_ID(0xf0, 0x01) 0 0x100000>;

                        spi0: spi@10600 {
				compatible = "marvell,armada-370-spi";
                                reg = <0x10600 0x28>;
                                #address-cells = <1>;
                                #size-cells = <0>;
                        };
		};
	};

What we really have though is additional registers that belong to
the SPI controller and that are not part of internal-regs, so
we need to move it up one level out of the internal-regs node in order
to add more registers:

        soc {
                #address-cells = <2>;
                #size-cells = <1>;
               spi0: spi@10600 {
			compatible = "marvell,armada-370-spi";
                       reg = <MBUS_ID(0xf0, 0x01) 0x10600 0x28>, /* control */
			       <MBUS_ID(0x01, 0x1e) 0 0x100000>; /* CS0 */
			       <MBUS_ID(0x01, 0x5e) 0 0x100000>; /* CS1 */
			       <MBUS_ID(0x01, 0x9e) 0 0x100000>; /* CS2 */
			       <MBUS_ID(0x01, 0xee) 0 0x100000>; /* CS3 */
			       <MBUS_ID(0x01, 0x1f) 0 0x100000>; /* CS4 */
			       <MBUS_ID(0x01, 0x5f) 0 0x100000>; /* CS5 */
			       <MBUS_ID(0x01, 0x9f) 0 0x100000>; /* CS6 */
			       <MBUS_ID(0x01, 0xef) 0 0x100000>; /* CS7 */
                       #address-cells = <1>;
                       #size-cells = <0>;
		};
	};

This lists all the addresses as seen from the MBus, but doesn't put them
into the CPU address space, which is then done by adding an entry in the
'ranges' property of the soc node:

	soc {
		ranges = <MBUS_ID(0x01, 0x1e) 0  0xe0000000  0x20000>; /* SPI 0 CS0 128kb */
		...
	};

I think it makes a lot of sense to define a separate window for each CS
at boot time, just so you don't have to reprogram the windows manually.
After all, the entire point of the direct mode is to avoid having to
do any of the setup work, and have the SPI master set the right CS
itself based on the MBus ID that is used for accessing the slave mmio
window. This is also required if we want to enable things like
XIP (DaX) mappings for file systems on a SPI-NOR flash.

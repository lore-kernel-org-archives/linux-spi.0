This function and all busywaiting should disappear now that the
interrupt-driven mode only interrupts once per four words instead of
doing a whole block transfer inside a single interrupts call.

Eh? Some new meaning of "non-deterministic" that I wasn'f familiar with? :)

Yes, it does look gross, but max clock rate is 3.7Mhz (7.4 in rev E2
silicon), so if your slowest device is 400kHz, in practice it only
runs the inner loop from 0 to less than 10.
How slow do SPI devices go in reality? The 254*256 divisor gives 100Hz.

Again, with the new interrupt-handling code you have to know the FIFO
size because if you regulate the TX filling with the FIFO_NOT_FULL_YET
status bit you end up with 8 words in the TX FIFO plus one word being
transmitted already and that makes 9, which can  overflow the receive
buffer (I've seen this happening in practice).

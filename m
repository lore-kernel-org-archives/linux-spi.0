On one of the platforms I work on we have 3 DMACs, peripheral 1, 2 and 3
can only use channels from controller 1, and the peripherals 4, 5 from
controller 2 and so on. They _absolutely_ need channel from specific
controller, so above suits it :).
Btw all three controllers _have_exactly_same_caps_ so dma engine will
not see any difference in channels. They don't know which peripherals
are connected to them, that's platform information which this scheme
seems to be suited to...
Can you tell me how your scheme will work in this case?

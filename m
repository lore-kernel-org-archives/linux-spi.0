Thanks for bringing up this topic.

We are working with these two patches (except the 
spin_lock_irqsave modification and the 'bool' datatype 
for bus_lock_flag) for several months on our system 
(powerpc, MPC8314, kernel 2.6.32.7 and 2.6.32.14) 
that makes heavy use of several SPI devices: 9 x EEPROM, 
3 x dataflash, MMC and 2 x MDIO-pseudo-SPI (with a special 
SPI-to-MDIO bus driver).
The MMC is used rarely, but the rest is essential for 
system operation. Until now, we observed no problems,
even when copying EEPROM data to MMC. So you may add
my 'tested-by'.

Best regards
Ernst

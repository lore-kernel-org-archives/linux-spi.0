Hi Ben,

I understand and appreciate the motivation.  However in practice, the
gpio api is sufficient for pretty much any use case, even when the
backing gpio controller driver ends up driving some oddball device
with different constraints.  The big downside to using a callback is
that it forces all users to do the extra work of implementing the
callback.  With the gpio api, only the oddball cases have to do extra
code (to adapt the custom device to the gpio api).

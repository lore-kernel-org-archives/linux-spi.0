It's a DAC so other way around but yes they have exactly that in the section:
https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ad5529r.pdf

	Register Details: Hotpath DAC registermap.

The is a brief description earlier of the whole feature that might
serve for this discussion:

"DAC HOTPATH
The DAC hotpath is a dedicated register region that optimizes
DAC updates in multidevice configurations where several AD5529R
devices share a common SPI bus. It reduces the number of SPI
frames required to write DAC data and supports synchronized
output updates across devices. In single device systems, the hotpath
offers no advantage over the standard register map and can be
disregarded."

As an example
MULTI DEVICE SW LDAC MODE 0 REGISTER
"This register sends a software LDAC update to the selected devices
that share the SPI lines but have different addresses, using the ID0
and ID1 pins. The selection is done on a per-device basis corresponding
to the configured bit field."

This one triggers all selected DACs (there is bit corresponding to
each address) to update in sync. (Lets put aside normal systems
where an LDAC gpio is wired to multiple devices as that is a whole
different problem).


It is this part that is driving the suggestion of having
a combined device representation for multiple physical devices.
In practice it is very similar to chained devices where we do that
already in that a longer access sequence is used to talk to multiple
devices at once.

Those SPI messages do not carry the address (or they are ignored - I didn't
dig into the mechanism).

Sure but that could just as easily be done with normal SPI and 3 chip
selects. For these devices there is no broadcast write magic (I think
anyway!)

This wasn't about use cases as such but the broadcast like facilities the
ADI parts have which to me smell like the main reason you'd put them on
a single bus and use this feature in the first place - you are making
one big DAC from multiple chips.

The broadcast stuff is what breaks this.  Otherwise I fully agree they
should be independent and we should have SPI allow that.

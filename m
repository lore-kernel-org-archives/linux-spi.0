Fair enough. I am starting to see at least a second driver (internally 
for DRA7 IRQ/DMA crossbar) doing the same handling for different bit 
sized registers. maybe now is the time for us to create a lighter 
version of mmio. mmio at least the last I looked uses spinlocks and is 
fairly fast. But, I agree, when the client of regmap uses locks to 
protect operations of their own, regmap might be a bit of an overhead. 
that said, replicating regmap logic in the driver looks a bit weird and 
might allow the basis for other drivers to do the same as well as some 
users of mmio would consider themselves performance sensitive :(.

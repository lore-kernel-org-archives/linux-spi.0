problem with those guys is that they're used all over the place so any
changes there would always be extremelly intrusive and are prone to
cause regressions :-(

I could try to allocate some time to play with dma.c but I can only test
on omap3 since my n810 isn't mount root on mmc, maybe I screwed up
something and can't remember what :-s if you happen to have tips, I'm
all ears. The thing is rebooting with "mbus" bootreason. I'll have to
dig up some legacy docs to figure out what's that.

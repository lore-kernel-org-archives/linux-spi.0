I am debugging another issue with UBIFS wherein pages allocated by
vmalloc are in highmem region that are not addressable using 32 bit
addresses and is backed by LPAE. So, a 32 bit DMA cannot access these
buffers at all.
When dma_map_sg() is called to map these pages by spi_map_buf() the
physical address is just truncated to 32 bit in pfn_to_dma() (as part of
dma_map_sg() call). This results in random crashes as DMA starts
accessing random memory during SPI read.

Given, the above problem and also issue surrounding VIVT caches, I am
thinking of may be using pre-allocated fixed size bounce buffer to
handle buffers not in lowmem mapping.
I have tried using 64KB pre-allocated buffer on TI DRA74 EVM with QSPI
running at 76.8MHz and do not see any significant degradation in
performance with UBIFS. Mainly because UBIFS seems to use vmalloc'd
buffers only during initial preparing and mounting phase and not during
file read/write.

So, is it an acceptable solution to modify spi_map_buf() to use bounce
buffer when buffer does not belong to lowmem region?

Hi,

some news.

My theorie is wrong with fifo frame lengths. Actually, they can be be of 
arbitrary length and the SPI chip select (CS) terminates a frame. Thus, the 
complete fifo can be filled at once, and single bytes can be written, as well.

However, a zero-length write seems to confuse the chip. If I prevent it, 
everything works.

As already mentioned, all regmap operations return success.

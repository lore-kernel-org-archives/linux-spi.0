    It wasn't said that somebody concrete was going to work on it. I had to 
explcitly write an email laying all further responsibility on CPPI 4.1 support 
on TI back then.

    Yes, of course. In my original mail that started the discussion I said 
that we have to wait indefinitely for TI to write the new DMA driver. I just 
wondered wouldn't it be better to use the same approach as for EDMA with 
transitioning to drivers/dma/ step by step.

    OK, I apologise if you consider yourself the target of my blame. My aim 
was rather to establish the truth about that decision taken back in Dec 2010 
-- which we seem to have achieved.

    Nothing. My blame for the lack of progress has long been laid on TI, after 
I explictly passed the responsibility for the driver to them. My intent with 
the mail that started the discussion was to probe whether we still have 
another opportunity of having MUSB DMA support for OMAP-L1x and Sitara. I just 
thought that you might have changed your mind somehow on the matter.

WBR, Sergei

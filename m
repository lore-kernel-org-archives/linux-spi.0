Indeed it was may mailer which had broken the patch. I use
git-format-patch and git imap send to create the mail. But when I
open it from the draft folder to add the email address, it decides
by itself to remove an end of line!
It is not the first time that I have some problems with Thunderbird.
I consider changing my mailer to a more "hacker friendly" one.

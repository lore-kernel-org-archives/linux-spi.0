So I see 2 distinct options:

Have the nor driver modified to run SPI commands and then ask the
SPI framework (and driver) to switch into mmap mode:

Would probably look something like this inside the nor driver:
    /* lock spi bus for other activities */
    spi_bus_lock(spi);
    /* send the "configuration" for mmap */
    t[0].tx_buf = flash->command;
    t[0].len = m25p_cmdsz(nor);
    spi_message_add_tail(&t[0], &m);
    t[1].tx_buf = dummy_buffer;
    t[1].len = dummy;
    spi_message_add_tail(&t[1], &m);
    spi_sync(spi, &m);
    /* switch to mmap mode */
    spi->mode |= SPI_MMAP;
    spi_setup(spi);
    /* run the mmapped transfers bypassing the spi-layer */
    memcpy(...)
    /* open questions here: which address range
     * and how to detect if transfer is done
*/
/* restore back to "normal" mode */
    spi->mode &= ~SPI_MMAP;
    spi_setup(spi);
    /* unlock spi bus for other activities */
    spi_bus_unlock(spi);

The downside is that it requires modification in several places
(nor-framework, spi-framework plus the driver) and it would not
be generic enough...

IMO such a situation is feasible if we only got a single device
on the spi-bus, but leaves a lot of questions open...
Alternatively we could create an additional api.

On the other end of spectrum could be a solution where the
spi-master driverwould have the opportunity to query the
device-tree for specific propertiesduring the spi_add_device
phase - in this case querying the followingproperty in the
device-tree:
   spi-master-XXX,use-mmap-cmd-mode = <0x08 0x38>;
to implement mmap-mode for commands 0x08 and 0x38.

Maybe we would want to also encode the number of address bytes
to send per command without hardcoding those values explicitly:
so maybe something like:
   spi-master-XXX,use-mmap-cmd-mode = <0x08 2> <0x38 3>;

Obviously these would need to get documented in the bindings
documentation of that driver.

Alternatively we could also introduce generic alternate modes
for the driver(similar to GPIO - ALT modes), but that would be
less transparent and more hard-coded...

In the end this would mean that from the nor framework side
therewould be no change at all - it still would be issuing
something like this:
    /* send the "normal" block read command */
    t[0].tx_buf = flash->command;
    /* note that the address would be encoded here */
    t[0].len = m25p_cmdsz(nor);
    spi_message_add_tail(&t[0], &m);
    /* dummy bytes could also get added to the above transfer */
    t[1].tx_buf = dummy_buffer;
    t[1].len = dummy;
    spi_message_add_tail(&t[1], &m);
    /* the real transfer */
    t[2].rx_buf = read_buffer;
    t[2].len = transfer_size;
    spi_message_add_tail(&t[2], &m);
    spi_sync(spi, &m);

On the spi-master side the driver would need to run:
*  if the spi-message (in this case the first byte) matches
    the "allowed" command pattern:
   * "setup" device in normal mode preparing the transfer engine
   * mode-switch to "mmapped" mode
   * copy via mmapped mode (via DMA to avoid blocking the CPU?)
   * return to "normal" mode
* else
   * run in "normal" spi mode.
(obviously it would be a bit more complicated that that).

Note that a discussion in regards to spi-master methods called
duringspi_add_device has just come up a few days ago in a
slightly differentcontext - forcing to always/never use DMA mode
for a specific spi-device on the bus (as well as tuning other
parameters per device).

Obviously the additional properties should describe required
HW behaviour and not tune the driver parameters - sys should be
used for those, but also for implementing those sys parameters we
would need those above "hooks"...

Just an idea.

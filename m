I tried, though it's a bit tricky for dt-bindings. When I created the
patch, using 'dt-bindings: $SUBSYSTEM' appeared to be the most common
one, ahead of '$SUBSYSTEM' (mainly used for combined patches)
and other random prefixes.

I'll resend it with just 'spi:', but I don't think there is a broad
consensus on this in the existing patches.

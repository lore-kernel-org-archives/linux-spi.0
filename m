Yes, cfr. "add a few calls to smp_mb()" above.

ACTLR = 0x000000c0 on CPU 0
ACTLR = 0x00000040 on CPU 1

0xc0 = EXCL | SMP
0x40 = SMP

The different EXCL value seems strange to me, especially considering the comment
about the matching cache controller configuration:

[7] EXCL
Exclusive cache bit.
The exclusive cache configuration does not permit data to reside in L1
and L2 at the same time. The exclusive cache configuration provides
support for only caching data on an eviction from L1 when the inner
cache attributes are Write-Back, Cacheable and allocated in L1. Ensure
that your cache controller is also configured for exclusive caching.
0 = disabled. This is the reset value.
1 = enabled.

CCing the list with the more ARM-knowledgeable people...

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

                        Geert

The patch

   dt-binding: spi: add NPCM FIU controller

has been applied to the spi tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/spi.git for-5.4

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

+* Nuvoton FLASH Interface Unit (FIU) SPI Controller
+
+NPCM FIU supports single, dual and quad communication interface.
+
+The NPCM7XX supports three FIU modules,
+FIU0 and FIUx supports two chip selects,
+FIU3 support four chip select.
+
+Required properties:
+  - compatible : "nuvoton,npcm750-fiu" for the NPCM7XX BMC
+  - #address-cells : should be 1.
+  - #size-cells : should be 0.
+  - reg : the first contains the register location and length,
+          the second contains the memory mapping address and length
+  - reg-names: Should contain the reg names "control" and "memory"
+  - clocks : phandle of FIU reference clock.
+
+Required properties in case the pins can be muxed:
+  - pinctrl-names : a pinctrl state named "default" must be defined.
+  - pinctrl-0 : phandle referencing pin configuration of the device.
+
+Optional property:
+  - nuvoton,spix-mode: enable spix-mode for an expansion bus to an ASIC or CPLD.
+
+Aliases:
+- All the FIU controller nodes should be represented in the aliases node using
+  the following format 'fiu{n}' where n is a unique number for the alias.
+  In the NPCM7XX BMC:
+  		fiu0 represent fiu 0 controller
+  		fiu1 represent fiu 3 controller
+  		fiu2 represent fiu x controller
+
+Example:
+fiu3: spi@c00000000 {
+	compatible = "nuvoton,npcm750-fiu";
+	#address-cells = <1>;
+	#size-cells = <0>;
+	reg = <0xfb000000 0x1000>, <0x80000000 0x10000000>;
+	reg-names = "control", "memory";
+	clocks = <&clk NPCM7XX_CLK_AHB>;
+	pinctrl-names = "default";
+	pinctrl-0 = <&spi3_pins>;
+	spi-nor@0 {
+			...
+	};
+};

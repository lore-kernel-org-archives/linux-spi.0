I was referring to

spi.c - SPI init/core code

Yes a more generic or new structure would be good,
but the current one does work for slave mode also.

Conditional checks for slave/master mode have been added in
the driver where required.

We currently support both FIFO and DMA for
slave mode

So would it be possible to merge the slave support also for
now, and could be modified to support the new slave interface
as and when available.

The FIFO is only going to be enabled when the DMA is used for transfer =
so we
should have some lower limit for the PIO/DMA threshold. The FIFO in McS=
PI is a
tricky one anyways, since it has only one FIFO but several channels and=
 the
=46IFO can be enabled for only one channel, if it is enabled for more c=
hannels
it is not going to be used by either channel.

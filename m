The patch

   spi: stm32: fix example with st, spi-midi-ns property

has been applied to the spi tree at

   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/spi.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] spi: stm32: fix example with st, spi-midi-ns property

This patch aligns example with the optional property description,
removes status and replace spidev unvalid compatible with
Aarvark SPI Host Adapter one.

In slave mode, Aardvark SPI Host Adapter requires 4ms delay
between the end of byte n and the start of byte n+1, hence the
use of the optional property st,spi-midi-ns.

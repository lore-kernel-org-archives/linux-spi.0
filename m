If it is out of MFD, then I'm not sure why you would care too much about
it as you won't be maintaining that code. And I still this what was done
was correct but I'm open to test what you suggest.

I was just commenting on changing the mode at runtime.

Yeah, I understood that but I didn't comment because I'm not sure this
will work yet.

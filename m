   I have already sent them countless times and even stuck CPPI 4.1 support (in
arch/arm/common/cppi41.c) in Russell's patch system. TI requested to remove the
patch. :-(

   Why? Inventra is a dedicated device's private DMA controller, why make
universal DMA driver for it?

   Don't think it's a good idea.

I got tired of fixing this in Renesas drivers manually, so I took the big
hammer. Remove this cumbersome code pattern which got copy-pasted too much
already:

-	struct platform_device *pdev = to_platform_device(dev);
-	struct ep93xx_keypad *keypad = platform_get_drvdata(pdev);
+	struct ep93xx_keypad *keypad = dev_get_drvdata(dev);

A branch, tested by buildbot, can be found here:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wsa/linux.git coccinelle/get_drvdata

I have been asked if it couldn't be done for dev_set_drvdata as well. I checked
it and did not find one occasion where it could be simplified like this. Not
much of a surprise because driver_data is usually set in probe() functions
which access struct platform_device in many other ways.

I am open for other comments, suggestions, too, of course.

Here is the cocci-script I created:

@@
struct device* d;
identifier pdev;
expression *ptr;
@@
(
-	struct platform_device *pdev = to_platform_device(d);
|
-	struct platform_device *pdev;
	...
-	pdev = to_platform_device(d);
)
	<... when != pdev
-	&pdev->dev
+	d
	...>

	ptr =
-	platform_get_drvdata(pdev)
+	dev_get_drvdata(d)

	<... when != pdev
-	&pdev->dev
+	d
	...>

Kind regards,

   Wolfram

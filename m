I don't find any previous discussion about way to inform flash
dual-ness into spi-nor
from spi drivers.

Here is my idea, probably others may think same.
Informing dual_flash from drivers/spi through flags or any other mode
bits is not a better approach as dual flash feature is specific to
spi-nor flash controller (controller specially designed for spi-nor
flash not the generic spi controller).  So if the driver sits on
drivers/mtd/spi-nor/ (ex: fsl-quadspi.c), may be we can inform flash
specific things to spi-nor as it's not touching generic spi stack in
Linux. But there is a defined-drawback if the driver is moved to
drivers/mtd/spi-nor ie it can't use spi core API's at-all.

thanks!

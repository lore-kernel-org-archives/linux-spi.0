So, what I am doing here in my code is that whenever I desired to use a
mmap operations I do a

a. flash_lock()
b. wait till the previous erase/write is finished
c. 'get_buf' which in turn does
       - get_sync
       - enable memory mapped

d. memcpy
e. 'put_buf' which in turn does
            - disable memory mapped
            - put_sync


f. flash_unlock

Do you see any point missing here?

On your comment about disabling transfers while doing a mmap..
Are you suggesting on having a check in qspi transfer api something like 
this..

transfer_one_message {
  if (mmap)
      return -EINPROGRESS;
}

Where mmap can be set/unset in get_buf/put_buf respectively.

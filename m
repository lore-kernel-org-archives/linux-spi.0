Cool!! I can test that on my platform.

I'm no your side suggesting not to use DMA for 3110/3100, but David and
others have a valid point, we don't know what kind of SPI controller that
this driver will work with, and the driver has to be as general and
compatible as possible.

heh, I don't have benchmarks but simply the copy/paste stuff and using
zmodem sometimes.

Checking T bit has to be done in word level, send one word out, read one
back and check T bit inside one spi xfer.

Why not use the buffer model, the HW has a 8 words RX buffer, why not read
8 words back in one spi xfer, saving a lot of system cost. And if we make
the spi clk slightly slower than the baud rate, there will be no TX
overflow problem.

Some function will be called in several places, say re-entered, hard to use
a preallocate buffer.

OK, got your point now. test/set_bit's cost depends on the platform, 
and my simple test using perf tool showing it cost 10us level to wake
a running thread.
Anyway, re-wake it does no harm :)

We dont need IRQF_NO_SUSPEND flag in our qspi controller.

Qspi driver need to be prevented from receiving interrupts during system 
wide suspend/hibernation.
"suspend_device_irqs" in kernel/irq/pm.c marks interrupt line in use and 
sets IRQS_SUSPENDED
for them.
If we use "IRQF_NO_SUSPEND", we will bypass setting this IRQS_SUSPENDED 
flag, which is not.
desired


For this, interrupt lines need to
  and this function is provided for this purpose.
  * It marks all interrupt lines in use, except for the timer ones, as 
disabled
  * and sets the IRQS_SUSPENDED flag for each of them.

This flag gets used in __disable_irq api(kernel/irq/manage.c) which

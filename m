I am not getting the point why the driver is declaring the max transfer 
length value and not following the rule.

Because it makes no sense IMHO. I can't see any single point in allowing 
long PIO transfers. Can you find at least one ?

I think we should reuse as much SPI core code as possible. The SPI core 
can handle an SPI message with multiple transfers,
all we need is to have max_transfer_size = FIFO depth and restrict it in 
transfer_one().

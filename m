If its at SPI level, then I guess each individual drivers which cannot
handle vmalloc'd buffers will have to implement bounce buffer logic.

Or SPI core can be extended in a way similar to this RFC. That is, SPI
master driver will set a flag to request SPI core to use of bounce
buffer for vmalloc'd buffers. And spi_map_buf() just uses bounce buffer
in case buf does not belong to kmalloc region based on the flag.

Mark, Cyrille, Is that what you prefer?

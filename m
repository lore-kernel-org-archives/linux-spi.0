Sure, if you keep clocking the chip, the data will keep going. Is the
chip being clocked ?

Doesn't the PL330 have some kind of a counter register where you can check
how much data were received so far ? That should be sufficient to verify
this hypothesis of mine.

If the DMA doesn't complete in certain amount of time, it should time out
I'd say. Don't you think ?

Did you find what this could be please ?

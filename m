No worries, I was just starting to think about this again myself.

Having now finally having had a chance to implement a gpio_chip driver,
I agree. It's quite simple and seems to fill the need pretty well

I think you are probably right. GPIO seems to be a good fit.

Patch coming shortly.  I use spi_board_info.controller_data to pass the
gpio number to the controller which doesn't seem like the best way
forward, but I wasn't sure how else to proceed. Also, since the gpio
numbers are dynamically determined spi_board_info.controller_data must
be filled in at runtime, which is also a bit of a bummer (although not
easily solved as far as I can tell). Let me know what you think.

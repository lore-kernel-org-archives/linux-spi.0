Subject: [PATCH 0/6] Preliminary SoC and board integration for RSPI on RZ/A1H

This patch series contains preliminary support to integrate Renesas RSPI on
the RZ/A1H aka R7S72100 SoC, and the Genmai development board.

Note that the prosed DT bindings also talk about QSPI on the R8A779x, as
those SoC use the same driver. The actual driver doesn't use DT yet, but
conversion to DT is planned.

The series is based on renesas-devel-v3.13-rc5-20131223, with Magnus'
pinctrl, Wolfram's riic, and Simon's gether work applied on top.
It hasn't received much testing, so please don't apply yet.

    [1/6] pinctrl: sh-pfc: r7s72100: Add RSPI support
    [2/6] ARM: shmobile: r7s72100: Add RSPI clocks
    [3/6] ARM: shmobile: r7s72100: Add RSPI resources
    [4/6] [RFC] Documentation: dt: Add Renesas RSPI/QSPI bindings
    [5/6] [RFC] ARM: shmobile: r7s72100 dtsi: Add RSPI nodes
    [6/6] [RFC] arm: shmobile: genmai reference: Add RSPI nodes

Thanks for your comments, and Merry Christmas!

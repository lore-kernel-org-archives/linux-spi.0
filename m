You can do a nasty type punning trick if the generic pdata is the first
member of the platform data, otherwise the easiest thing is usually to
provide a defualt pdata if the pdata is NULL.

I'd expect that in a lot of cases the standard platform data would be
the only platform data so for many drivers they wouldn't need to worry
about extra data but perhaps MMC isn't like that, I've never really
looked at the code.

The patch

   dt-bindings: spi: add stm32 qspi controller

has been applied to the spi tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/spi.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: spi: add stm32 qspi controller

This patch adds the documentation of device tree bindings
for the STM32 QSPI controller. It is a specialized communication
interface targeting single, dual or quad SPI Flash memories (NOR/NAND).

+Required properties:
+- compatible: should be "st,stm32f469-qspi"
+- reg: the first contains the register location and length.
+       the second contains the memory mapping address and length
+- reg-names: should contain the reg names "qspi" "qspi_mm"
+- interrupts: should contain the interrupt for the device
+- clocks: the phandle of the clock needed by the QSPI controller
+- A pinctrl must be defined to set pins in mode of operation for QSPI transfer
+
+Optional properties:
+- resets: must contain the phandle to the reset controller.
+
+A spi flash (NOR/NAND) must be a child of spi node and could have some
+properties. Also see jedec,spi-nor.txt.
+
+Required properties:
+- reg: chip-Select number (QSPI controller may connect 2 flashes)
+- spi-max-frequency: max frequency of spi bus
+
+Optional property:
+- spi-rx-bus-width: see ./spi-bus.txt for the description
+
+Example:
+
+qspi: spi@a0001000 {
+	compatible = "st,stm32f469-qspi";
+	reg = <0xa0001000 0x1000>, <0x90000000 0x10000000>;

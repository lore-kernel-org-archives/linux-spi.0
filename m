I have put the maintainers of the relevant subsystems as CC in the comm=
it
message and sent the series to all of the mailing lists. This series wa=
s
touching 7 subsystems and I thought not spamming every maintainer with =
all the
mails might be better.

In v2 I will keep this in mind.

The series depends on the first two patch, which adds the
dma_request_slave_channel_compat_reason() function.

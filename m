It certainly does on the surface. However, when wrong data is
delivered over the SPI bus (such as when I use wrong phase setting)
the SPI controller happily delivers wrong data over PIO.

The failure I am seeing is that the pl330 DMA program which repeatedly
waits for data from the SPI controller never finishes the read loop
and does not signal the interrupt. It seems it also leaves some data
in a FIFO somewhere so next command on the flash returns garbage and
fails.

I'm not as convinced this structure is generally useful and belongs in
the interconnect core. The thing that strikes me as weird with putting
it in the core is now we're saving these values both inside and
outside the interconnect core. In the GENI case here, we only really
need them to undo the 0 votes we cast during suspend. If "vote for 0
in suspend and whatever it was before at resume" is a recurring theme,
maybe the core should give us path_disable() and path_enable() calls
instead. I'm thinking out loud, maybe Georgi has some thoughts.

Akash, for now if you want to avoid wading into a larger discussion
maybe just refactor to a common structure local to GENI.

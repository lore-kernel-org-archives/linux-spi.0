If you check the sizes of the transfers for the MMC case it is something like:

[ 1796.080000] ep93xx-spi ep93xx-spi: setup: mode 0, cpsr 2, scr 0, dss 7
[ 1796.080000] ep93xx-spi ep93xx-spi: setup: cr0 0x7
[ 1796.080000] ep93xx-spi ep93xx-spi: ep93xx_spi_process_transfer: transferring 512 bytes
[ 1796.080000] ep93xx-spi ep93xx-spi: ep93xx_spi_interrupt: handling interrupt
[ 1796.080000] ep93xx-spi ep93xx-spi: ep93xx_spi_read_write: tx=512, rx=512
[ 1796.080000] ep93xx-spi ep93xx-spi: ep93xx_spi_process_transfer: transferring 2 bytes
[ 1796.080000] ep93xx-spi ep93xx-spi: ep93xx_spi_interrupt: handling interrupt
[ 1796.080000] ep93xx-spi ep93xx-spi: ep93xx_spi_read_write: tx=2, rx=2
[ 1796.080000] ep93xx-spi ep93xx-spi: ep93xx_spi_process_transfer: transferring 1 bytes
[ 1796.080000] ep93xx-spi ep93xx-spi: ep93xx_spi_interrupt: handling interrupt
[ 1796.080000] ep93xx-spi ep93xx-spi: ep93xx_spi_read_write: tx=1, rx=1

So size of the transfer varies, depending on what kind of message
is passed from mmc_spi to the driver. From the above, we can see
that ep93xx_spi_read_write() transfers 512 bytes before passing control
back to the calling interrupt handler.

I got the same results with polling enabled (this is with v3 which is not yet
posted).

I think that when the controller is enabled (SSE is set), it is
transmitting/receiving once there is data (TX). It even enables the
SPI output clock only when TX data is put into TX FIFO (I checked
this with oscilloscope).

I added debug print to this function (ep93xx_spi_wait_busy()) and
it loops only once. If I don't wait while the bit is cleared, the
controller hangs.

Since SPI is full-duplex, I think that it is enough to just perform
another transfer once we get RX/TX interrupt. This also makes the
driver simpler (yet not the most efficient).

At least if you see my comments above, the driver seems to do the
right thing (for example it transmitted one spi_transfer at a time
without busy looping).

Yup, I noticed same thing. Once BSY bit is cleared, RX FIFO can be
read without hangs (or something like that).

I'm not sure.

For me, current strategy seems clear:
	1. Fetch next message
		1.1 Enable the SPI controller
		1.2 Assert chip-select
		1.3 Fetch next transfer
			1.3.1 Enable interrupts (if not polling)
			1.3.2 Perform the transfer
				write/read to/from the FIFO
			1.3.2 Disable interrupts (if not polling)
			... (for all spi_transfers)
		1.4 De-assert chip-select
		1.5 Disable the SPI controller
		1.6 call msg->complete
		...

It isn't the most optimized but my purpose was to get it working first. Since I only
have one ep9302 board and 2 SPI devices, it limits my testing a bit. Thanks to you
I've got very valuable input related to the driver :)

If you have time, I suggest that add some printk()s to the
ep93xx_spi_wait_busy() and see whether it busy loops in your device
(or does some other weird things).

It is an GCC extension:

http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.4.3/gcc/Conditionals.html#Conditionals

I've been using it once I saw it somewhere in the kernel source.

Thanks again,

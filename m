It is documented as a boolean in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-controller.yaml
with the following description:

      spi-cs-high:
        $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/flag
        description:
          The device requires the chip select active high.

So I don't think it is about it being undocumented.

Yeah that seems like a plausible way forward if we want to
move away from the legacy way of specifying polarity.

We don't need to implement the perfect solution up front.
We can aim for that in the long run. I usually go by the IETF
motto "rough consensus and running code".

I suggest to go both way:
apply this oneliner and tag for stable so that GTA04 works
again.

Then for the next kernel think about a possible more abitious
whitelist solution and after adding that remove *all* "spi-cs-high"
flags from all device trees in the kernel after fixing them
all up.

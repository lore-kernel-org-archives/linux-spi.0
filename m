regarding the first option, may be others also should agree to it (in
case if somebody is
using the gpio 0).
In the second option if the gpio number is set in the probe, then we
are overwriting the
actual gpio number assigned in the platform data.
If I move the cs_gpio from the platform data to controller private
data then the dependency
on other platforms can be removed, but still the check (true or false)
before setting the gpio
line will remain. If agreed upon this i can go ahead and post the patch

I agree, that's why I wrote the dev_pm_opp_set_rate() API initially.

But that isn't any different from drivers doing clk_disable directly,
right ? So that shouldn't worry us.

I am not sure I understood this well. The reference counting within
clk/regulator should let both the layers (driver and opp core) work
just fine. Why would a driver don't want OPP core to call
clk_prepare_enable() all the time ?

Right, so I would like that to be part of this series when this gets
implemented.

I don't remember any such cases, I may have forgotten about those
though.

I am okay with it. I don't want to invent another set of APIs to
enable / disable the resources.

Yeah, we may need to come up with something like this eventually. I
had written something like that earlier, but then it wasn't required.

Not sure I understood it. Can you explain with some example please ?

We need the boot-constraint framework for that. I think this is a
problem which we have currently as well. I am waiting for the
bus-scaling framework to get in, after that we will have lot of cases
where boot-constraints would be required and it won't be limited to
just clcd then.

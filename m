If device is able to do custom waveform can't it also do regular effects
(constant, periodic, etc. Or is custom is actually random and you are
doing something like rumble effect?

Why is this driver not using the memoryless FF  library (and extends it
to handle FF_CUSTOM effects) but rather reimplements it in the driver
itself?

"To compile this driver as a module". Also please keep Kconfig and
Makefile sorted alphabetically.

Thanks.

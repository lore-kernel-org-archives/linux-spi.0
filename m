Huibing is using pio to test this case, and we still achieve it
successfully? That means there may be some minor diff for the pio
path between your chromium repo and my local branch.

Could you get spi-rockchip.c of rockchip local kernel 4.4 from Caesar
to see if you could transfer 64KB with the one we're using?

Thanks, looks good overall. A couple of minor points here:

While it might be obvious, I'd add something like

       The eight register sets following the control registers refer to
       chipselect lines 0 through 7 respectively.

I prefer writing this as

		reg = <MBUS_ID(0xf0, 0x01) 0x10600 0x28>,	/* control */
		      <MBUS_ID(0x01, 0x1e) 0 0x100000>,	/* CS0 */
		      <MBUS_ID(0x01, 0x5e) 0 0x100000>,	/* CS1 */
		      <MBUS_ID(0x01, 0x9e) 0 0x100000>,	/* CS2 */
		      <MBUS_ID(0x01, 0xde) 0 0x100000>,	/* CS3 */
		      <MBUS_ID(0x01, 0x1f) 0 0x100000>,	/* CS4 */
		      <MBUS_ID(0x01, 0x5f) 0 0x100000>,	/* CS5 */
		      <MBUS_ID(0x01, 0x9f) 0 0x100000>,	/* CS6 */
		      <MBUS_ID(0x01, 0xdf) 0 0x100000>;	/* CS7 */

Same for the ranges below.

Are you sure about the 1MB length for each one? I don't remember seeing this
limitation in the datasheet, so maybe the length should be specified as
0xffffffff (we can't use 0x10000000 unfortunately as that doesn't fit within
a 32-bit cell), to make it possible to map larger register areas.

This does however raise an interesting question about the size that we actually
want to map:

Your patch at the moment maps the entire register area that is listed for
a given CS, which simplifies the code, but it means that we can't easily
provide a smaller map in the mbus ranges when we know we don't need as
much address space. I had not considered that in my previous emails.

This is not a problem for the external bus because we can just map however
much space the attached device requires, but for SPI devices, the address
field in DT is just the CS number, not a range of addresses and the partitions
of e.g. an SPI NOR flash are then in a separate DT address space that does not
get translated into CPU addresses using 'ranges'.

This would be easier if have a conclusive proof that 1MB per CS always enough.
Is this something that is guaranteed in the SPI spec or the documentation for
this controller?

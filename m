Additionally to the current DMA transfer the PDC allows to set up a next DMA
transfer. This is useful for larger SPI transfers.

The driver currently waits for ENDRX as end of the transfer. But ENDRX is set
when the current DMA transfer is done (RCR = 0), i.e. it doesn't include the
next DMA transfer.
Thus a subsequent SPI transfer could be started although there is currently a
transfer in progress. This can cause invalid accesses to the SPI slave devices
and to SPI transfer errors.

This issue has been observed on a hardware with a M25P128 SPI NOR flash.

So instead of ENDRX we should wait for RXBUFF. This flag is set if there is
no more DMA transfer in progress (RCR = RNCR = 0).

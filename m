=46inally I had time to check this. If you compare the 8250 (or similar=
)
data-sheet with the MAX31x0 one you see that the handling of the
RTX/CTS bits is exactly the same (8250 about RTS bit for example:
"When any of these bits are cleared, the associated output is forced
high." and MAX3110: "Request-to-Send Bit. Controls the state of the
RTS output. This bit is reset on power-up (RTS
bit =3D 0 sets the RTS pin =3D logic high)."). If you look at the 8250.=
c
driver (grep for UART_MCR_RTS) you notice that the bit is set on
device open (together with DTR of course). So I think the driver is
doing the right thing here.

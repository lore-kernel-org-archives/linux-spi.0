There are ordering issues with these patches and the patch they depend
on.  Basically, as-is it is not bisectable.  The above platforms stop
working after the SPI driver changes are applied, but before these
patches are.  You'll need to update the mode field for all the users
in or before the SPI driver changes patch to preserve bisectability.
Then you can have subsequent cleanup patches....

Or just squash all the patches into the SPI driver patch.  I'd be
okay with that in this case because the board changes are well
contained and easy to understand.

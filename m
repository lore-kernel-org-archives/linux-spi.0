Just so you know, pretty much everything else except SPI, regulators, 
and ASoC follows 'dt-bindings: <binding dir>:' these days.

I don't really care so much about the difference, but it is tribal 
knowledge that submitters have to learn. 

Really, this could all be solved with tooling using MAINTAINERS and 
get_maintainers.pl, but limping around in checkpatch.pl occasionally is 
enough perl for me.

All that matters is CC'ing the DT list really. And Mark R is pretty much
AWOL. Reviewing bindings in front of your own will get yours reviewed 
faster. :)

Right.

I generally only take single patches not in a series with dts or driver 
changes and when/if the subsystem maintainer doesn't pick them up. Or 
any standalone fixes I'll take.

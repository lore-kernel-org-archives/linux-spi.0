I'm not speaking of a broken interrupt source, I'm speaking of a broken code,
such as in the handler, or broken status readback, or lack of understanding on
the status register which may imply the while(1) to loop forever.

The point is if you stay forever in the while(1) loop, you can at least have a
print a backtrace (LOCKUP_DETECTOR).

Sure, but can you be sure that all the people modifying the code after you will
see that also ? The other way will _force_ them to see it.

Okay, that's acceptable.
Why not have something like this :

sccr1_reg = pxa2xx_spi_read(drv_data, SSCR1);
if (!(sccr1_reg & SSCR1_TIE))
	mask &= ~SSSR_TFS;

/* Ignore RX timeout interrupt if it is disabled */
if (!(sccr1_reg & SSCR1_TINTE))
	mask &= ~SSSR_TINT;

status = pxa2xx_spi_read(drv_data, SSR);
while (status & mask) {
   ... handlers etc ...
   status = pxa2xx_spi_read(drv_data, SSR);
};

There is a duplication of the status read, but that looks acceptable, and the
mask calculation is moved out of the loop (this should be checked more
thoroughly as it looked to me only probe() would change these values, yet I
might be wrong).

Cheers.

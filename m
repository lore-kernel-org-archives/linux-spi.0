I consider the "if not yet locked, take lock" pattern logically akin
to a recursive mutex, but apologies if the language was imprecise.

Well then what exactly is the contract for who can access it and who
can't? What I'm experiencing is that, when the driver for one device
on the spi bus has the bus locked, other devices access the bus with
no synchronization at all, resulting in serious data corruption. The
media-change-detect probe also does this even with a single mmc device
on the bus.

Reverting commits 24c8cd1b0812, 49023d2e4ead, and 556351f14e74 (the
first two revert cleanly; the latter I did by hand) makes the problem
go away.

Ah, in that case maybe the actual bug is just one line of commit
24c8cd1b0812? Reverting just that also seems to make the problem go
away.

OK. I didn't understand what synchronization prevents messages from
multiple drivers/sources from getting pushed at the same time, but
apparently the problem was just that spi_sync was behaving like
spi_sync_locked when the bus was already locked.

*Nod*, OK.

Hello Mika,

I finally was able to get this working on my system.  Not sure what the issue
was earlier.

The only thing I don't like right off hand is the chip select handling.

The way it currently is done you are limited to using only the built-in GPIO's
of the EP93xx.  This prohibits a system from using an external i2c/spi/etc.
gpio expander to provide more chip selects.  And if a platform is not setup
correctly, the BUG_ON in cs_to_gpio in your example for the tx72xx is pretty
nasty.

Ryan and I worked out a runtime setup/cleanup for the spi device chip selects
in the spi driver I have in my tree.  I will take a look at it and see how
much trouble it will be to implement in your driver.

Anyway, now that I have your driver functioning I will be able to actually
provide some feedback to you.

Regards,
Hartley

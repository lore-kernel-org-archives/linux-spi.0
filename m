How about if I told about the vibration device a little? :)

The device can only accept analog signal with relatively narrow
frequency band. The bit stream consists of n-bit wide words that
are interpreted as PWM pulses. PWM pulses are used to generate
the desired waveform (close to sine wave).

One problem is that wave period needs to be symmetric in order
to avoid DC-offset. Therefore, we always have to play complete
periods. Another issue is that due to narrow frequency band,
we'd like to minimize the gap (or at least keep it quite stable)
between waves as that would affect the overall frequency once
again. Narrow band also means that the overall mechanics plays a
bigger role and probably needs more careful tuning.

Due to tuning issues, I'd prefer custom data provided by user
space. By that we would avoid compiling kernel unnecessarily.
Calculating the waveforms in the driver with help from board
specific functions sounds tempting as well, but would it be
better approach after all?

I don't know how I missed this one :( So if FF_CUSTOM is the
option to take, it makes sense to move the buffers to the
memoryless FF library.

I'll fix this.

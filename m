Hi,

the only thing that I still don't like is the way of sending characters.
Basically, the spi rate is set to the actual baud rate when characters
are transmitted to the uart, and multiple characters are sent without
looking at the status of the uart.

The spi rate and the uart clock aren't synchronized, what happens if the
spi rate is slightly higher than the MAX3100's baud rate clock?
In addition, if there are other devices on the spi bus, the bus will be
occupied unnecessarily long, especially when low baudrates are used.

One other small cosmetic thing:
in serial_m3110_tx_empty(), TIOCSER_TEMT should be returned instead of
1.

Well, the discussion was mainly about how the regulator API should be used.
The proposed patch, used the regulator API incorrectly.
If I recall correctly, in the end of the discussion,
Mark provided another option for configuring the regulator API,
which is number 3 below.

The thing is that ads7846 chip itself just requires power supply
(as most of the peripheral chips), the one who decides if it will be switchable
is the board vendor and the vendor may use any source for the power supply.
It can be fixed, it can be some kind of discrete LDO or one of the power
supplies coming from the system PMIC.
The ads7846 driver provides the regulator functionality via the regulator API
and it is up to board code to provide the appropriate regulator definitions or
configure the regulator API so the ads7846 will function correctly.

IMO, this is the right way.

Mark,

Is there a kind of regulator for this case (except dummy)?
Some kind of fixed regulator which is not binded to any supply?

This looks like the regulator definitions for spitz are broken and need to be fixed.

Not quite.  The key is the cookie system DMA engine employs to indicate
when a cookie is complete.

Cookies between the "issued sequence" and "completed sequence" are defined
to be in progress, everything else is defined to be completed.

This means that if "completed sequence" is 1, and "issued sequence" is 5,
then cookies with values 2, 3, 4, 5 are in progress.  You can't mark
sequence 4 as being complete until 2 and 3 have completed.

If we need out-of-order completion, then that's a problem for the DMA
engine API, because you'd need to radically change the way "completion"
is marked.

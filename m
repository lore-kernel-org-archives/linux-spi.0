Or maybe we should not introduce a new Kconfig option and just reuse
the old one. It probably requires re-ordering patches a bit (patch 1
should be moved after patch 5). Then you have 2 choices:

1/ merge patch 1 and 6 so that the new driver effectively replaces the
   old one but uses the same Kconfig option
2/ remove the ability to compile the old driver when the new one is
   introduced: remove the line from drivers/mtd/spi-nor Makefile and
   move the Kconfig entry from drivers/mtd/spi-nor/Kconfig to
   drivers/spi/Kconfig. And remove the old code in a separate patch

I'm fine either way, but option #2 will probably make the patch
introducing the new driver bigger and hurt readability.

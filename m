I figured "priming the fifo" before turning the transfer over to the
interrupt handler would help.

Exactly what I did.

I am surprised my this :-(.  I thought getting rid of the extra
interrupt context switches would help the data transfer time.  Oh well...

It looks like splitting the 8/16-bit read/write routines does help
with cpu usage compared to the tests above.  Was the data transfer
(kB/sec) any better?

Agree.  Kind of a pain...

Yes.  Too bad we can't also combine multiple messages that might be in
the queue...

But, if this gets to complicated it might not be worth holding off
getting it merged, at least into linux-next or possibly into the
staging branch.  At that point it will be easier to provide patches.
I still have one hanging for Mika to expand the chip select options.

That might work but I think it could break horribly.  The "jiggery-pokery"
could end up being pretty messy.

But, the tx-fifo-is-half-empty might be what is needed to handle the
multiple transfer merging.  We know the driver is finished transfering
the data to the fifo when (espi->tx == t->len).  At this point we are
just wating for the last (fifo_level) bytes to come in on the rx fifo,
this could be anything from 1 to 8 bytes.  If it's <= 4 the next interrupt
will be a tx-fifo-is-half-empty which is killing us trying to pull those
last bytes out of the rx fifo.  So how about something like this at the
end of ep93xx_spi_read_write:

	if (can_continue && espi->tx == t->len) {
		if (fifo_level < SPI_FIFO_SIZE/2) {
			/*
			 * Pull the next transfer out of the queue and
			 * use it to finish filling the tx fifo.  The
			 * next interrupt will complete this transfer.
			 * We then need to continue with the next transfer.
			 */
		}
	}

The DMA engine might help but it's not here yet....

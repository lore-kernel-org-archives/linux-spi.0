I wanted to let you know that the support of other SPI protocols has al=
ready
been implemented by this series:
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2015-September/37=
1170.html

patches 2 & 3 handle the probing of the (Q)SPI memory in spi_nor_scan()=
 and
select the right protocols for register read/write, memory read, memory=
 write,
and memory erase operations. The choice is done according to both the m=
emory
and SPI controller capabilities.

patch 4 updates the m25p80 driver to take advantage of the bandwidth in=
crease
allowed by QSPI protocols. For instance, the Atmel QSPI controller, lik=
e TI
one, maps the SPI NOR memory to the system bus. Yesterday I ran mtd_spe=
edtest
to compare Fast Read 1-1-1 (0x0b) and Fast Read 1-1-4 (0x6b). The SPI c=
lock
frequency was limited to 83MHz. The QSPI memory is a Micron n25q128a13.

I only had to change the mode argument of spi_nor_scan() from SPI_NOR_Q=
UAD to
SPI_NOR_FAST in the atmel_quadspi driver (based on fsl-quadspi driver f=
rom
=46reescale since Atmel's driver also uses the system bus mapping for m=
emory
write operations) to force the spi-nor framework to choose the SPI 1-1-=
1
protocol instead of the SPI-1-1-4.

1 - Fast Read 1-1-1

mtd_speedtest: testing eraseblock write speed
mtd_speedtest: eraseblock read speed is 9319 KiB/s
[...]
mtd_speedtest: testing page read speed
mtd_speedtest: page read speed is 6649 KiB/s
[...]
mtd_speedtest: testing 2 page read speed
mtd_speedtest: 2 page read speed is 7757 KiB/s

2 - Fast Read 1-1-4

mtd_speedtest: testing eraseblock read speed
mtd_speedtest: eraseblock read speed is 30117 KiB/s
[...]
mtd_speedtest: testing page read speed
mtd_speedtest: page read speed is 13096 KiB/s
[...]
mtd_speedtest: testing 2 page read speed
mtd_speedtest: 2 page read speed is 18224 KiB/s

So the performance improvements are:
eraseblock read speed (65536 bytes) : +223%
page read speed (512 bytes)         :  +97%
2 page read speed (1024 bytes)      : +135%


That's why I believe that you could take advantage of these performance
improvements in the TI (Q)SPI controller driver.


Also please note that you may have to add in the struct spi_flash_read_=
message
two other fields for the number of option/mode cycles and their value.
Option/mode cycles are sent between the address and dummy cycles. They =
are
used by some memory manufacturers such as Spansion, Micron and Macronix=
 to
enter/leave their continuous read mode.
So if uninitialized dummy cycles are interpreted by the QSPI memory as
option/mode cycles, depending on the actual value, the memory may enter=
 by
mistake in continuous mode. Once in continuous mode, the command op cod=
e byte
must not be sent and is not expected by the memory: the memory implicit=
ly uses
the read op code sent in the SPI message which triggered the memory to =
enter
continuous read mode. Next SPI messages start from the address cycles u=
ntil
the right option/mode cycles are sent to leave the continuous read mode=
=2E

Currently the mtd layer doesn't use this feature but it should be aware=
 of it.
That's why I believe we'll have to address this point in spi_nor_scan()=
 and the
"regular" m25p80() sooner or later.

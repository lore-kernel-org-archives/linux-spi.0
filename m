Well maybe I didn't use the correct words.
During the system life, I monitored the CS behaviour using a oscillosco=
pe.
I also activate debug in omap2_mcspi, so I see when driver disable the
clocks and restore context when device is not used.
Each time the CS is in the correct state. It is only when there is a
suspend with the following configuration that on resume the CS is in
wrong state( ie activated)


echo 1 > /mnt/pm_debug/enable_off_mode
echo 0 > /mnt/pm_debug/core_pwrdm/suspend
echo 1 > /mnt/pm_debug/voltage_off_while_idle

I didn't see any problem in idle case, just when system resume from a
suspend to ram (echo mem > /sys/power/state)

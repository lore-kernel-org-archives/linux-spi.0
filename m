Selecting native chip selects for iMX SPI devices in a devicetree
configuration does not work. That is the case for imx25 based SoC
parts, and I think for imx31 SoC as well. There is no problem with
configuring SPI ports to use a GPIO as chip select.

Selecting native chip selects via the old platform setup code will
work, it is only devicetree configurations that are broken.

With platform configuration you specify a native chip select by
setting the cs_gpio for the SPI device to be "32 - chipselect",
This will be a negative number - and thus not a valid GPIO number.
And that "chipselect" is the actual hardware native chip select
number.

You cannot specify the cs_gpio in dvicetree as a negative number,
so this whole scheme does not work. The common method in devicetree
is to set the cs_gpio entry for your device to be "<0>". If you do
this to configure your SPI device to use a native chip select it is
valid, but the SPI device cannot be accessed (no valid read data
returned from it).

The problem lies in the way the spi-imx.c driver sets up the
controlling registers of the iMX SPI block. It doesn't have the
correct logic for using nativce chip selects in the devicetree case.

The best fix is to use the "chip_select" associated with the SPI
device as passed in from the devicetree (as the "reg" tag) or directly
in the platform data structure. The hitch with that is that field is
not set correctly by some platform device code.

The following patches fix the platform setup code to correctly set
the "chip_select" for the SPI device and to set the SPI registers
correctly based on that.

These changes affect the iMX machine code and drivers/spi subsystem so
I have sent this to both lists for feedback.

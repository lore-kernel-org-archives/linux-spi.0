Unfortunately, I did not get the time to review and test this
sufficiently for the 3.15 merge window, but to avoid further delay, I've
queued it up in l2-mtd.git [1] under its own branch for now. I rebased
it myself, to accommodate for changes to m25p80.c since your submission.
Please take a look at the branch.

If all goes well, I should merge the spinor branch into master some time
after the 3.15 merge window closes, so it will get linux-next testing.
For any additional comments/corrections (I have a few), please just
submit patches on top, rather than resending the whole series.

Marek, what was your opinion on this series? Last response I saw was
"looking good"; is that an Ack? Or did you have any more gating
requests?

Personally, I think it looks ready enough, and it's better to merge this
than not. I was able to test with my platforms, with no regression.

Lee, I have a few patches that do some trivial unification of your ST
SPI FSM driver and the SPI-NOR framework. I plan to send these out
soon, and I will begin applying any ST-FSM patches to the same spinor
branch along with Huang's code. I hope that you can spend some effort on
improving integration within the next few months in preparation for
3.16, when I expect this to all go upstream.

Thanks,
Brian

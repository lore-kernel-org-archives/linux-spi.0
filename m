I've added linux-spi mailing list to all the patches sent as part of 
this series. Not sure why you didn't get other patches. Today I've 
explicitly added you in all the patches.
This change series basically enabled interconnect (as per 
bindings/interconnect/interconnect.txt) support in GENI QUPs based 
drivers so appropriate BW request can be put based on SE usages.
here is my complete change series:

I hope I answer to your question properly.

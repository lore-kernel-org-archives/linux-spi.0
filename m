I see a logical problem with this patch.

Suppose the clock driver supports following frequencies: 500M, 800M,
1G, 1.2G and the OPP table contains following list: 500M, 1G, 1.2G
(i.e. missing 800M).

Now 800M should never get programmed as it isn't part of the OPP
table. But if you pass 600M to opp-set-rate, then it will end up
selecting 800M as clock driver will round up to the closest value.

Even if no one is doing this right now, it is a sensible usecase,
specially during testing of patches and I don't think we should avoid
it.

What exactly is the use case for which we need this patch ? What kind
of driver ? Some detail can be helpful to find another solution that
fixes this problem.

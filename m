Hi Gregory,

If you've only got one patch then please put all the explanation text
into the patch description.  Using a cover letter like this is only
useful when describing the context for a series (more than 1) of
patches.  Also, revision history should always be in patch
description, regardless of whether or not there is a cover letter (at
least for the subsystems that I maintain.  Otherwise, it is too easy
for vital information to get separated from the patch.

Thanks,
g.

Hi David,

I've answered Erwin's comments before in v1 submission cycle, following
is the quote:

"I agree there should not be 2 drivers cover 1 family of HW, so this is a RFC.
I've thinked about merge with current 3100 code, but it depends on one char
per spi_transfer, while my driver relys on batch data transfer for efficiency.
Another key point is the console, SPI UART can't be directly accessed by
CPU, so every spi_transfer will go through tasklet/workqueue, which makes
supporting printk a big part of my driver."

I really did consider about that, but has no good clue, so I think better to
shape my driver first.

Thanks,
Feng

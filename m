I tried enabling the EXCL bit for ACTLR on CPU 1, but it doesn't make
a difference.

One other thing: As I was playing with m25p80, I had #define DEBUG at the
top of drivers/mtd/devices/m25p80.c. This doesn't cause much kernel output,
just one message before every read:

    spi0.0: m25p80_read from 0x00108600, len 512

However, without the #define DEBUG, it's _much_ more difficult to trigger
the issue.

It was configured as level on the first install/request and the driver is
not changed between rmmod and insmod, so it again requests level on the
second request.

Here a very much trimmed down version of the driver

It is severely cut down (and not 100% clean), but it shows the behaviur already!
in the real driver the request_irq happens in a later stage…
But this way you do not require the HW to replicate it and it reduces components...

Here the example right after a reboot (but on a downstream 4.9 Kernel) 
with TRIGGER_FALLING:

Hope that shows the issue.

As far as I see it the free_irq (or something else) does change something
in the info structure of the interrupt, so that it is now
configured as edge not level.

This means that it fails on the second attempt.

How/where this happens is unclear to me.

I darkly remember that there was something with regards to bcm2835 and
level interrupts, that had to be implemented as edge with a wrapper layer
to implement level or something…

But then I may be wrong here.

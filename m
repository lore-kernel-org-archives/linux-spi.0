This idea has nothing to do with the dma-safe problem you pointed out, I will
make the buffer dma safe anyway.

What I proposed just wants to provide some flexibility for protocol device
drivers, it will use dma-safe buffer always, but it prefer not to use DMA
for its one-word transfers, and hope to have a choice to do that. For current
existing controller and device drivers, they can simply ignore the new 
working mode setting in struct spi_master and spi_transfer and leave them
as 0.

Thanks,
Feng

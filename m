    This can't be split into the MUSB DMA driver, as the neither of CPPI 4.1 
devices are really MUSB specific. The support should be generic.

    Didn't quite get this sentence.

    If not somewhat earlier... anyway, I wasn't able to spent much time on 
this project in 2010.

    I'm probably masochistic then since I'm still sending MUSB patches, eben 
though I wasn't working on it at MV until I switched to Kontron boards 2 weeks 
ago. Now my task is fixing USB bugs on real Sitara with dual MUSB. :-)

    I don't know why Kevin didn't merge it then. I remembere he didn't like

    Hm, it seems to have happened back in 2008 when I was working on CPPI 4.1 
code. Too bad I only knew that drivers/dma/ are for accelerating RAIDs back 
then (if actually noot later than that).
    TI seems to put more efforts into its Arago project than in supoporting 
the cutting edge (or not) CPUs in mainline -- at lest things seem go there 
first. Many Arago patches never reached mainline (not that they can be applied 
without cleanup though).

I don't remember the exact details, but I think we had come up with
a generic constraint solving algorithm to pick appropriate windows for
each device with a (close to) minimal use of physical address space,
and we defined the DT binding for MBus in a way that would let us
implement that algorithm at a later point if we ever found we needed
it, but then decided against implementing it because it puts a lot
of complexity at the very early boot: it needs to do a deep walk
of all enabled child device nodes to find the size and alignment of
every reg property that translates into an mbus address, and figure out
a set of mbus translations that convert those into CPU phys addresses
without using too many mbus windows or too much address space.

I don't understand the question. The client device here is the SPI
controller, right? That doesn't need to have a special binding, it
just needs to list the registers relative to the mbus address space
like any other device, and that is independent of how we implement
it.

It looks like Stefan's patch tricks here by creating an incompatible
binding for mbus that bypasses the address mapping.

Is checking the T bit really necessary if Linux instead tracks the
timing between bytes internally?  ie.  If the driver uses an hrtimer
to schedule the submission of SPI transfers such that the time between
SPI submissions is always greater than the time required for a serial
character to be transmitted?

You may be able to set this up into a free-running state machine.
Submit the SPI transfers asynchronously, and use a callback to be
notified when the transfer is completed.  In most cases, the transfer
will be completed every time, but if it is not, then the state machine
can just wait another time period before submitting.  By doing it this
way, all the work can be handled at the atomic context without any
workqueues or threaded IRQ handlers.

Here's some draft )completely untested and uncompiled) code for the
bottom half:  The time rate would be calculated when the baud rate is
set.  I've glossed over a bunch of details and corner cases, but you
get the idea...

void max3100_spi_complete(void *__max3100)
{
  struct max3100_port *max3100 = __max3100;
  spin_lock(&max3100->lock);
  max3100->busy = 0;
  /* Process received characters here.  Schedule a workqueue if
needed.  A ring buffer would probably work well. */
  spin_unlock(&max3100->lock);
}

enum hrtimer_restart max3100_hrtimer_callback( struct hrtimer *timer )
{
  struct max3100_port *max3100 = container_of(timer, struct
max3100_port, hrtimer);

  if (max3100->busy)
    return HRTIMER_RESTART; /* still busy, try again later */

  spin_lock(&max3100->lock);
  /* The following 7 lines can probably actually be done once at
driver probe time */
  spi_message_init(&max3100->spi_msg);
  spi_message_add_tail(&max3100->spi_tran);
  max3100->spi_tran.tx_buf = mac3100->tx_buf;
  max3100->spi_tran.rx_buf = mac3100->rx_buf;
  max3100->spi_tran.len = 2;  /* can this be larger to receive
multiple bytes in 1 transfer? */
  max3100->spi_msg.complete = max3100_spi_complete;
  max3100->spi_msg.context = max3100;
  /* Alternately, a bunch of transfers could be queued up with only
the first actual
   * containing tx data.  The rest would be for RX */

  if (&max3100->tx_pending) {
    /* a ring buffer may be a better idea here */
    max3100->tx_buf[0] = max3100->tx_pending_data;
    max3100->tx_pending = 0;
  }
  spi_async(&max3100->spi_msg);
  max3100->busy = 1;  /* cleared by the completion callback */

  spin_unlock(&max3100->lock);

  return HRTIMER_RESTART;
}

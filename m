with this input and looking closer, I think I see what you are saying now:
dra7xxx_qspi_prepare_xfer -> does a pm_runtime_get_sync
dra7xxx_qspi_unprepare_xfer -> does a pm_runtime_mark_last_busy, 
pm_runtime_put_autosuspend

In between these calls, you have the remaining xfer calls going on.
we are assuming here that autosuspend timeout should be greater than the 
time to complete the worst case transfer.

Is that a valid assumption? would it not be better to mark_busy at other 
points? my thought is that considering a threaded isr, if by any chance 
you have a latency > autosuspend due to premption or some un-forseen 
event, this could crash badly, no? mark_busy will atleast ensure that 
runtime timer is reset. yep, we can also argue to converse, with a 
autosuspend delay set to appropriate value, we should not see this 
issue. pm_runtime_mark_last_busy() may be executed from interrupt 
context as well. At least going with "marks the last time of the 
device's busy state" we dont seem to mark them at all potential points?

ofcourse we can debate about how granular the marking should be, IMHO, 
though, I like autosuspend, however, I like autosuspend as a way to 
reduce transfer-to-transfer latency to re-enable the clocks. I however 
am a bit gittery about autosuspend kicking inside required time 
boundaries (especially considering the delay is upto user of the system).

Just my 2 cents.

my bad. fair enough.

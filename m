Ok, so here is some summary.

I have a NOR flash attached to a s3c64xx SPI controller with 64byte
fifo and a pl330 dma controller.

Normally DMA controller is used for transfers that do not fit into the FIFO.

I tried adding the flash memory ID to the spi-nor driver table and
adding a DT node for it.

The flash is rated at 120MHz so I used that speed but the ID was
bit-shifted and identification failed. There is DT property
samsung,spi-feedback-delay for addressing this and at 120MHz it must
be 2 or 3 on this board. 40MHz works with default value 0.

The next step after identification worked was to try reading the flash
content. For this the DMA controller is used because data is
transferred in blocks larger than 64 bytes. When reading the whole 4MB
flash the transfer failed silently. I got a 4MB file of all ones or
all zeroes.

It turns out that

 - the pl330 locks up when transfering large amount of data.
Specifically, the maximum power of 2 sized transfer at 120MHz is 128
bytes and 64k at 40MHz. Transferring more than this results in the
pl330 locking up and never signalling completion of the transfer. Data
is left in FIFO which causes subsequent commands to fail since garbage
is returned instead of command reply. Also subsequent read may cause
I/O error or or return an empty page depending on the garbage around.

- the I/O errors are not checked in spi-nor at all which leads to
silent data corruption.

On a suggestion that this may improve reliability I changed the
s3c64xx driver to use DMA for all transfers. This caused
identification to fail in spin-nor because the ID was prefixed with
extra 00  byte. Testing with spidev confirmed that everything is
prefixed with extra 00. Also when the DMA controller locked up no
transfers were possible anymore. When DMA was not used for sending
commands the controller would recover on next command. I made the
option to always use DMA configurable and it turns out that the
returned data is prefixed with 00 only when no transfer without DMA
was ever made. Loading the spi-nor driver with the dma-only option off
and then with dma-only option on results in correct operation. Only
loading the dma-only driver first causes the 00 prefix.

Thanks

Michal

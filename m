Then you need to internalize more of the docs on the DMA
calls ... :)

Notably see in Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt the section up top
where it describes what memory can be used for DMA, and very
explicitly states stack data is not appropriate.

When the SPI master controller driver uses DMA and the caller
doesn't set up mappings, that controller driver does the DMA
mapping operations.  That's what those code paths rely on.

You're writing code sitting a layer above that driver for the
SPI master controller.  Your code won't know whether DMA will
be used or not, so your code must either (a) use DMA-safe buffers
in the first place, or else (b) use spi_write_then_read() which
provides a small bounce buffer.  A non-option is (c) write your
code so it breaks on controllers that use DMA.

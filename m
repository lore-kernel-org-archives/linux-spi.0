Interesting idea. It should be possible to add a dynamic MBus
window allocation / configuration, similar to what pci-mvebu.c
does. I'll give it a try to implement this dynamic MBus
configuration in the next version.

Yes. This was meant just as an example - a quite bad one, I agree.
I'll change this.

It works, at least on the FPGA that I'm programming the bitstream into
right now. The reason for deasserting the CS after each SPI transfer
was, to work around potential problems with concurrent accesses to
other SPI devices connected to the same SPI controller. Like SPI NOR
flash devices using the "normal" indirect mode. Deasserting the CS
seemed like the "safe" way to me here.

Right, a check is missing here.

This patch only adds support for the direct write mode. As the main
purpose is to speed up the SPI TX throughput for FPGA bitstream
programming. It could be extended to support also the direct read
mode. But this would need more configuration options, like the
number of address-bytes to transfer in each read access. Not sure
how this should interact with the SPI flash driver from the MTD
subsystem.

I would prefer to not adding this direct read mode just yet. It
can be added later, if really needed.

Thanks,
Stefan

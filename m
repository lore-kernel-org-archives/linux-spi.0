That's definitely the plan. I was able to start this effort
independently by converting the Davinci mmc and spi drivers to dmaengine
before I took this step. I've got the next micro-step of addressing
omap_hsmmc in process (pending on agreement on a dmaengine api change
with Vinod), cleaning up the mcasp driver is also pending this series so
that it can also be converted to dmaengine. Once mcasp (or "davinci
audio") is converted, we're rid of all the in-kernel users of the
private API and can get rid of this...which also is helping clean up
mach-davinci, of course.

If I can get your ack on this patch that should move things along to
these next steps.

Thanks,
Matt

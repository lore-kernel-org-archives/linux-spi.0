Yes, using a high resolution timer instead of udelay is definitely better.
The reason we didn't use it is the delay for 115200 bps is about 90us,
which is shorter than the time of executing an hr_timer(IRQ handling and
precess waking stuff), but it's our HW's problem anyway.

But this doesn't help on buffer read/write, and only works for one word per
spi_transfer model as 3110 only has 1 word TX buffer and 8 word RX buffer.
We normally use such a test case, Ctrl+C a big string (500 Bytes), and Ctrl+V
it on the 3110 console, check if they are correctly received and echoed on
screen, one word per transfer can hardly make that, due to the cost in spi
layer and tty layer, while buffer read/write model can.

If "speed_hz" are not for this case, then where should it be used for,
spi core already has "max_speed_hz" specifying the maxim clock permitted by
HW. Using speed_hz does affect other devices connecting to the same controller,
but can we provide an option for the platform code to chose whether dynamic
lower spi clk is allowed, in case the spi controller has only 3110 as its
slave device.

The patch

   spi: sirf: account for const type of of_device_id.data

has been applied to the spi tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/spi.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] spi: sirf: account for const type of of_device_id.data

This driver creates various const structures that it stores in the
data field of an of_device_id array.

Adding const to the declaration of the location that receives the
const value from the data field ensures that the compiler will
continue to check that the value is not modified.  Furthermore, the
const-discarding cast on the extraction from the data field is no
longer needed.

Done using Coccinelle.

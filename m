Now I think I really managed to add Linus W to Cc, sent too fast
earlier.

But I guess we should enable the dummy states only for other
board-*.c files, not board-generic.c?

Right, sorry I meant "non DT pinctrl drivers"..

Hmm but shouldn't it be call pinctrl_provide_dummies() only
for other boards except board-generic.c? And that is assuming
we don't have any other "non DT pinctrl drivers" around.

Yes agreed, except let's just produce a warning for the pinctrl
errors..

..as otherwise not much will work at this point :)

I suggest all pinctrl errors should show up as warnings with
board-generic.c, but we should not exit out of the driver probe
on errors.

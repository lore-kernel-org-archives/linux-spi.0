They probably shouldn't, there's a lot of legacy drivers that do all
sorts of fun stuff but if people are having performance problems we
should probably be putting pressure on the driver users to improve
things.  Anything that has a bounce buffer probably isn't going to say
it can do DMA though...

I don't think we can tell any better than anything else really.  We
could tell if a driver has a bounce buffer or is PIO based but that's
not the whole story so it's not ideal.

That seems better.  It'd be really good if we had a function we could
call that'd do the mappings including any bounce buffering that's needed
rather than having to think about it in the subsystems.

We have tightly coupled the link-time dependency for
omap_dma_filter_fn by going down the path of using
dma_request_slave_channel_compat() as Tony suggested to avoid extra
ifdefry.

That dependency will go away naturally if all the "legacy" OMAP platforms
were required to only boot from DT...just as a newly added SoCs are.

Are you suggesting unwinding the _compat() approach?

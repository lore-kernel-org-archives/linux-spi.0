I haven't actually looked for the underrun by checking the SSPSR_BSY
bit but my guess is actually underruns a lot more than that.  Depends
on where you are doing the check above on if you actually see it.

During the 512+2+1 message that is sent when the mmc_spi driver is
doing a block read, the 512 byte transfer goes like this:

1) 8 writes, prime the tx fifo
	SFRMOUT asserts when the first bit of the first byte starts 
	transmitting
2) Interrupt
3) 8 reads, we must have emptied the tx fifo and filled the rx fifo
	SFRMOUT de-asserts after the the last bit of the last byte is
	received
4) 8 writes, fifo's are empty so we re-fill them
	SFRMOUT asserts when the first bit of the first byte starts 
	transmitting
5) end of interupt
6) go back to 2

Basically, anytime the espi->fifo_level == 8 and we can do an 8 byte
read you have to assume that the SFRMOUT signal has already been de-
asserted.

This matches what I am seeing with the logic analyzer.

I have modifed my board so that I now have an external GPIO for the chip
select.  That chip select goes low then shortly after, the SFRMOUT signal
goes low and 8 bytes are pumped out then SFRMOUT goes back high.  A bit 
later the interrupt happens, indicated by another GPIO I toggle in the
interrupt routine.  Right before the interrupt ends I again see SFRMOUT
go low and 8 more bytes are pumped out.  The interrupt actually completes
before the data is all pumped out.  But again SFRMOUT gets de-asserted
before the next interrupt occurs.  This keeps happening until all the
data in the message is finally transferred, at which point the external
GPIO chip select is finally de-asserted.

With a slow enough clock you can probably get to a point where SFRMOUT
will stay deasserted during the entire 512 byte transfer.  But it would
still de-assert during the switch to the next transfer in the message.

Regardless, I tend to agree with you.  Because of the chip design, it's
impossible (or at least you can't guarantee) to keep the SFRMOUT low
during a transfer.  Some devices can live with this others can't.  Oh well.

A Documentation/spi/ep93xx_spi.txt really should be created to note this
limitation as well as showing an example of the platform support needed to
use this driver.

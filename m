Yeah similar to am33xx with different clocks and with a bunch of accelerators.

OK yes a dmaengine event router works too when available. Good to see
them as separate driver instances now :) Are only the dts changes missing
now?

FYI, when we have separate interconnect driver instances, we don't want to
and cannot tweak registers outside the interconnect instance because of them
being in separate clock and/or power domains :p

In any case, it seems there's no harm using pinctrl for evtmux on dm81xx
until the event router is available. It's currently only needed on the
t410 emmc that I'm aware of :)

Yes dynamic muxing of the dma channels sounds like file corruption waiting
to happen :) Let's stay away from that.

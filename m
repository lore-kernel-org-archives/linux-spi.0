I guess the second one with mutex.
This is my work-in-progress-mix patch:
http://www.penguin.cz/~utx/zaurus/feed/images/spitz/zImage-3.0.0-rc5+-spitz.diff

Several hours later, charging was turned on/off at least 1000 times
without any crash. So it seems that it was the correct race condition
fix.

I guess that inserting of power supply initiates reading of voltages on
MAX1111. The long one may be touchscreen or LCD control.

I've setup a board with a spi-gpio port looped to a spi-mxs port in
slave mode so I can test this.  I did not need to change the DMA
timeout to get it to work.  If the master does not send enough within
the SSP timeout the slave transaction will timeout.  It does not seem
to ignore SS, but rather the DMA will not finish until all the
requested words are received, no matter how many SS pulses that
happens to take.  For general purpose slave support it would of course
be nice to be able to end the message when the master drops SS, but
the SSP either doesn't support this or a different technique is
needed.

I've found that if PHASE = 0, the SSP expects the SS to be pulsed high
between each word (w/ current driver, word == 8 bits).  This is
slightly alluded to in the imx28 manual, where the PHASE = 0
descriptions in sections 17.5.3 and 17.5.5 contain, "... in the case
of continuous back-to-back transmissions, the SSn signal must be
pulsed high between each data word[.]"  While for the PHASE = 1
descriptions in sections 17.5.4 and 17.5.6 it says, "For continuous
back-to-back transfers, the SSn pin is held low between successive
data words[.]"

One would think this is talking about master mode like the rest of the
section, but it seems to only apply to slave mode.  In master mode one
can easily produce a SPI signal without SS pulsed between each word
with either phase setting.

Testing with the master TX sending 1 byte per SS asserted period:
$ echo abcd1234ABCDwxyz | dd of=/dev/spidev4.0 bs=1

Slave RX receives the first four bytes:
$ dd if=/dev/spidev2.0 count=1 bs=4 | hd
[  638.673625] spidev spi2.0: Start POL 0 PHA 0
00000000  61 62 63 64                                       |abcd|

Trying with 4 bytes per SS assertion:
$ echo abcd1234ABCDwxyz | dd of=/dev/spidev4.0 bs=4
$ dd if=/dev/spidev2.0 count=1 bs=4 | hd
00000000  61 31 41 77                                       |a1Aw|

The slave receives the first byte of each SS assertion pulse.  If I
change the protocol to PHASE=1, then this case works as well and I
receive the first four bytes.  I didn't need to set POLARITY to 1,
just phase.

$ dd if=/dev/spidev2.0 count=1 bs=16 | hd
[  261.277000] spidev spi2.0: Start POL 0 PHA 1
$ echo abcd1234ABCDwxyz | dd of=/dev/spidev4.0 bs=4
00000000  61 62 63 64 31 32 33 34  41 42 43 44 77 78 79 7a  |abcd1234ABCDwxyz|

The same thing happens if the bs for the master size is to 1, 2, 8, or
16.  Setting it to another values like 3, 5, 32 doesn't work.  Maybe
the slave ignores extra SS pulses in the middle of a transfer, but
will fail to complete the transfer if it doesn't get SS de-asserted at
the end as expected?

The same can be said for a serial UART or an ethernet MAC, yet those
don't seem to be too hard.  I think the problem is that these devices
usually have things like FIFOs, IRQ trigger levels, pools of buffer
descriptors, etc. that are designed to handle this.  The design of
slave mode in SPI and I2C controllers seems to be more of an
afterthought, with none of the features one would except to deal with
it.  Also, the slave protocol design for things like EEPROMs often
have nanosecond scale latencies that are nearly impossible to achieve
in a general purpose CPU running a multitasking OS.  No one would
design a network protocol that requires an ACK packet within 10 ns of
receiving a REQ, and expect the CPU to handle that.  Yet that can be
expected of a SPI EEPROM.

However, there are applications where one can predict what the master
will do ahead of time and don't have these problems.  In my case I
know what and when the master will do something and can prime the SSP
with a matching slave mode transaction before the master initiates.  I
know I'm not the first person who has needed to do this on Linux.  So
maybe it's worthwhile to add a limited slave support system without
solving the problem of general purpose slave support.

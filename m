Do you mean register the notifier per controller instead of per
subsystem? Either way we need changes at the subsystem level and I
choose to follow the device tree implementation for consistency.

The other reason is that (pending other ACPICA changes) we can add
other notification events in the future such as node added or removed
(just like device tree), and in that case the probe and hotplug
handling would be different (and a bit more efficient).

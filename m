    Thanks again for taking your time to rummage thru the mail archives. I 
also did it, however not thru all threads (it turned out that the placement of 
CPPI 4.1 code was discussed also in the MUSB DMA driver related threads). 
Anyway, I was not a position to do extensive searching as it was already dead 
of the night in Moscow.

    OK, now it seems I misremembered.

    Being unable to fit it into drivers/dma/, and loating to place it into

    I probably did that out of hopelessness partly.

    Unfortunately, as I see it, that work is far from enough for CPPI 4.1.
I maybe don't know drivers/dma/ slave mode well, but adding CPPI 4.1 support 
would have required a complete redesign of all related interfaces.

    As we know, it was a bad idea generally.

    Didn't ever see that one.

    It was in reposnse to Ajay's email about Felipe's assumed intent to switch 
MUSB to drivers/dma/ API insted of its custom DMA API, AFAIR. To which I, of 
course, started to object. It wasn't about CPPI 4.1 driver at all.

    Now I don't even quite understand what (multiple?) ad-hoc APIs Felipe had 
in mind. There\ is one and only one DMA API in MUSB. Perhaps he meant the 
tusb6010_omap.c driver which is using OMAP DMA API?

    My intent wasn't to lay blame on anybody, just to restore the sequence of 
events which passed completely around me.

   I didn't really ignore requests to move to drivers/dma/, I just honestly 
didn't see how it can be done, and frankly didnt have much time to massively 
rewrite my stuff written back in 2008 based on earlier TI work. Then my 
project to push OMAP-L137 support simply ended (I can't restore the date now, 
perhaps this was somewhere in 2010), so I simply couldn't continue to invest 
big efforts in this work.

    It's crystal clear, thank you. I just thought something might have changed 
seeing how EDMA support moves to arch/arm/common/. Now I see it's not.

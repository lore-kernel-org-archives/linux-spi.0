This is just an acceleration provided to improve flash read speeds.
Whenever there is an access to QSPI memory map region, there is a
SFI_MM_IF block in QSPI IP that generates SPI bus signals in order fetch
the data from flash. This SFI_MM_IF must first be configured with flash
specific information like read opcode, read mode, dummy bytes etc (which
may vary from flash to flash), by writing to QSPI_SPI_SETUP*_REG also,
SFI_MM_IF needs to be selected by writing to QSPI_SPI_SWITCH_REG.
IMO, there has to be a call from spi-nor to ti-qspi before using
standard {read,write}[bwl]() calls for populating flash info, power mgmt
and locking SPI bus.

How would you propose to setup mmap transfers while taking care of SPI
bus locking and passing of flash info to ti-qspi?

No, even if there are multiple slaves, all slaves map to the same start
address (0x30000000 in above example). Based on the chip-select line
that is asserted (selected by writing to a particular CTRL_MODULE
register field), the corresponding slave responds. Different slaves
cannot be mapped to different address ranges inside mmap address space.
The ranges property will always be the same for all slaves and all
chip-selects.

There might be a SPI controller that provides accelerated interface for
SPI flash read not as a memory mapping but some-other way. Brian Norris
has pointed out that there is at least one other controller which
provides such acceleration w/o memory mapping[1] May be Brian can
explain that better?

hmm, right, check again, the rockchip drm would not depend on spi, but 
the edp driver does.

so the drm driver(display-subsystem) would probed before spi, but try to 
control the backlight in the suspend/resume...

so i was wrong in the commit message, will fix it in next version.

right, and maybe try to refresh the pwm reference when we bind it again

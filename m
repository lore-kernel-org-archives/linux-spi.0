Yes, this is plain data that could be nicely fit in the pci driver.

Sorry, I was talking about master defaults regarding to your patch that
proposes to remove that part from dw_dmac. I mean it should be set in
function mentioned early.

They are just defaults. Say, hardcoded. We just get master bus width and
number of masters we have, but we don't use them.

Actually here I just recall the case when we might have different number
of masters and use the same IP block [of SPI controller], how could you
distinguish that case? How to provide proper masters?

It's luckily not a problem right now, but still potential one in some
cases.

Yeah, ACPI / DT cases work / will work fine, since we can get any
information we need from there.

The microchip parts.  They are entirely independent. The device address is
just a way to save pins.  That is contrasting those with the one in this
series where the design assumes you want to treat them as a large logical
device in a similar way to spi device chaining.

I think we should often do this because there are some confusing cases
otherwise. See below.

To enumerate the cases:

1. One CS has multiple spi-device-address and needs to be a combined device.
	Given this ADC does some fun stuff to include messages with no
        spi-device-address that are meant to be received by all such
	devices we pretty much have to map any that share a CS to one
	logical device - we have to bind one driver.  This is kind of
	similar to SPI device chaining.
	address == cs.  spi-device-address property not used for that.
	- This one can be normal SPI style.

2. One CS has multiple spi-device-address but logically separate otherwise.
	This is the microchip devices I think.  For those the device-address
	is just a pin saving exercise.
	address == spi-device-address. CS not needed as there is only one.

2b.  Same as 2, but there is another normal ADC with a chip select.
	How do we know adc@spi-device-address vs adc@cs given they could
	easily take same address value by coincidence?

2c. Basically Case as 2 but * N CS all on same SPI bus.
	As David calls out this is the pin count minimization case.
	E.g. I want 8 devices each of which has 2 pin straps to set the
	device address.  So I have to use at least 2 CS.
	For this I need both cs and device-address and Conor's suggestion works.

There is a case of 1 + 2 with different device types but result is same
as 2c.

Now, to me the question is whether we say that if spi-device-address is
present you always do adc@cs,spi-device-address or do we allow for not
doing so for the composite devices where nothing else is sharing the CS
(like this driver).

My inclination is standardize on always doing it for these devices.

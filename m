Glad I could help.

www.findchips.com covers most of the usual US distributors.  It's not
really restricted to chips, any part number works fine.

Maxim encourages direct purchase from their web site, so sometimes that
is the best place to find stock.

There are 41 in stock at Avnet, in the TQFN package.  Not what you would
like to hand solder, but it can be done if the lands on the PCB are
designed to stick out farther than usual, so that you can get the iron
on the land (since you can't reach the pin itself).  A flux pen helps,
such as Kester #951 (but read the Material Safety Data Sheet).

As someone said on the net years ago (and still true, except for things
like ball grid arrays), "They haven't yet invented a surface mount part
that can't be hand soldered with a temperature controlled iron and $2000
worth of optics and lighting."

I don't have boards hand assembled any more.  The parts are just too
small, and you have to have a really good tech (or be one) to get a job
as clean and reliable as with soldering in a oven.  There are lots of
assembly houses out there.

I have been using TI translators recently; that is, when I don't use a
CPLD or FPGA (there's nothing quite like a programmable device when you
think of a better idea).  TI has a line of translators in small
packages. See, for example, 74LVC1T45, a single translator in a 6 pin
SC70 package that you could hand solder.  Wider parts probably make more
sense for your design.

Ahh, student budget vs. student labor.  That will change the range of
outside services that you can use.

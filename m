How about we kick this down the road. Leave the two microchip devices
alone for now with their vendor binding (which we have to carry on supporting
anyway) and just do the AD part.  For future devices we can push towards
that model if they have such a device-address feature. 

I don't mind changing the microchip parts in principle, but it is going
to be a non trivial change and I'd certainly be nervous to make it without test
parts

Of course if anyone does mix parts we have to think again.

Ping. Is this patch okay? I suppose that it will go via usb tree
as part of the whole series (you send fpga driver patches to Greg
anyway). Can you ack this patch or is there something that should
be changed? I'd like to see it merged in v4.21, so if there are
issues with this patch, I'll try to address it before it is to late.

Thanks,
Anatolij

The description of 9fdca9dfe093c76fe1ac1a09888ba9679d46996a seems to be
overly positive: "this will delete a few lines of code, no functional
changes".

But yes, the probe dependencies with omap's display are quite fragile.
The probe order should be something like (from first to last):

- omapdss, i2c, spi, etc.
- panel drivers
- omapfb

I fear that if we'd use EPROBE_DEFER in a panel driver, it'll lead to
omapfb missing the panel. And we can't use EPROBE_DEFER in omapfb,
because there's no way to know if all the panel drivers are loaded or
not.

I think the only reliable way would be to manage the panels dynamically,
so that omapfb will handle them no matter when they are added/removed.
But that's not done by just changing a few lines...

So, it's broken. One option, although hacky, would be to move all the
spi probe stuff from acx565akm's probe to acx_panel_enable. That will be
called by omapfb during late_initcall, at which point spi should be
available.

Well, I'll see how difficult the dynamic panel add/remove would be to
implement. And probably even dynamic add would be enough for the start.

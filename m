No problem. Thanks for looking into this.

Yes. My 1st patch version (still RFC) used fixed MBus windows instead:

http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-spi/msg06536.html

Mark suggested to use dynamic windows, so that one area could be
used for all SPI devices by switching (re-configuring) the MBus
window:

I also have no real preference here.

Good idea.

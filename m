For those playing at home that's "spi: fix possible deadlock between
internal bus locks and bus_lock_flag".  That won't work entirely since
that'd mean that we're not doing I/O locking to exclude the message pump
in cases where we push data directly in spi_sync() with the bus lock
held by a caller.  That's probably going to work most of the time as
most callers will be single threaded but they might not be.  It should
be saved by the checks to see if we're already processing a message
inside the pump function but it's better to be clear about what we're
doing I think, and we can clear cur_msg inside the message pump.  But
perhaps it's enough...  anyway, I'm not going to think through all the
cases properly at this time of night.

Please include human readable descriptions of things like commits and
issues being discussed in e-mail in your mails, this makes them much
easier for humans to read especially when they have no internet access.
I do frequently catch up on my mail on flights or while otherwise
travelling so this is even more pressing for me than just being about
making things a bit easier to read.

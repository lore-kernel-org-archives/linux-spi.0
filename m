I believe we could have similar dmaengine 'infra' for the built-in devi=
ce
properties as we have now for DT and ACPI. I need to dig deeper to get =
full
understanding on the device properties, but from a quick view it looks =
to me
that it could replace the direct OF and ACPI property handing in a unif=
ied
API. I might be totally mistaken here ;)

> Does this ".2" and so prevent driver to use auto ID for platform devi=
ces?

Yes, as all the infra around the traditional board files with platform_=
device
creation does. Ideally we could have 'phandle' pointing from this table=
 to the
device in question (or other way around), but I'm not aware of anything=
 we can
use.
Auto ID did not really worked for us since the driver does need to know=
 their
ID in some cases, or we need to be able to be sure that for example McA=
SP1 is
handled as davinci-mcasp.1
We have clocks and other dependencies where the device name or device I=
D need
to be predictable.
It is different in DT cases, but we are talking about legacy things.

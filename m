Hi guys,

it looks like the suspend sequence depends on the dt node sequence, and 
we are putting display-subsystem dt node above spi dt node, so it would 
be earlier in the device list, then got suspended later than spi device.

the pwm backlight and cros_ec_spi pwm are very interesting, not only 
about suspend dependency... if we unbind cros_ec_spi pwm, the pwm 
backlight would still hold a reference to it, and crash the kernel later.

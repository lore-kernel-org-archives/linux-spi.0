Sure, I will split this patch as below.

1.) reg map update
2.) hwmod update(like removing dma macros etc.) + runtime (if split,
git bisect can break)
     (Since clock handling will be done with hwmod)

Yes will have a single table for register offset, pass a
0x100(probably named as offset deviation)
value from platform data to be added while read/write to registers for
omap4 and others can have 0

Yes these params can be passed from hwmod data
This has to part of dev attribute data that can be passed from hwmod da=
ta.

hwmod layer is handling all clocks now.

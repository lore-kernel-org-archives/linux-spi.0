It wasn't outright rejected, but it was questioned.

That characterization is currently correct. I'm not a fan of what ofpart
does in the first place; I'd really like it if its binding was written
in a way that made it more precise, but we have to live with what we
have.

I also didn't like that you were designing your system such that we were
now keying off the fact that your node has no 'reg' property. This
seemed awfully fragile. (Admittedly, so is ofpart.c.)

All in all, if you have better suggestions, I'm all ears. (At first
glance, I'm liking your patch 1 to help disambiguate both MTD partitions
and the 'controller-data' node going forward.)

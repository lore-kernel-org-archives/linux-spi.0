My knowledge about SPI is minimal but this sounds reasonable. I just wo=
nder
why we've never seen this issue before? If the address byte is treated =
as data
then we should see it received on the other side, did you observe that?

I would personally move the zero checks of to_send to sc16is7xx_fifo_wr=
ite()
and just return early from there if to_send is zero. Even if this issue=
 is
somehow specific to your board/SPI controller we can treat this early r=
eturn
as an optimization :)
=20
As for the error check I would break out of the loop when we see the bo=
gus value
instead of just masking of the top bit. I think such value should not b=
e trusted at all.

Thanks,
Jakub

I agree. We had a very long debate about this when we first added
the support for MBus, and not much has changed. As far as I'm concerned,
this is where we're at:

The binding defines a reasonable set of default settings for each
device that uses MBus, and the OS can use them, or define its own.
Coming up with an algorithm to do this right however is very hard
and not really worth it, as defining the defaults works well enough.

Ideally we'd let the boot loader set up the windows statically and
have the DT describe what they are, but unfortunately that is not
what boot loaders in the field do.

The method that was picked for MBus is similar to how we typically
handle PCI host bridges that have the same problem: you can set up
translation windows between CPU addresses and the various PCI
address spaces (I/O, mem, prefetchable, config, ...) in all sorts
of ways, with various tradeoffs, but instead we just pick a
reasonable default and describe it in the DT, because the kernel
has no good generic way of picking a particular setting over another.

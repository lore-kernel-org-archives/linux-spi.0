OK, I checked v2 series you mentioned. Looks OK to me and applied into
next/dt-samsung because it is related in supporting dt.

Note, I applied all of them into same dt branch, the fist one 'fix the
incorrect hierarchy of spi controller bus clock for exynos4' can be sent to
upstream via fixes now though. And I changed the clock name for
exynos4_clk_mdout_spix to 'mdout_spi' for consensus when I applied.

If any problems, please let me know.

Thanks.

Best regards,
Kgene.

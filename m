BTW, Mark Brown already commented on this approach:

http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mtd/2015-May/059364.html

I quote:

Sounds OK to me. And as Mark noted, this could probably be done in the
core. I suppose Mark could suggest whether the most expedient path is to
hack the buggy driver to do this, or whether reworking the SPI core to
have the appropriate spi_master field(s) (and caveats) to support this.

I don't think spi-mxs.c really does this; it chooses between PIO and DMA
based on length, but with either option, it runs through each SPI
transfer in one go. You might be confused by the fact that this driver
implements ->transfer_one_message instead of ->transfer_one, so it has
to loop through all transfers in the message.

(IIUC, spi-mxs.c could easily be rewritten to use ->transfer, and some
of that not-too-complicated boilerplate could be killed off.)

Well, Lee, like you, I think this driver should not be a MFD driver,
but Alex has a good point of view.

Is possible to change modes on-the-fly, but you have no reason to do
that. On the PCB you will have a SPI slave or a serial console :)
Anyway, the current form of the driver, and through this I want to say
"this ugly hack", allows the user to switch from serial to SPI mode by
adding only one property to the device tree node of USART. If the
driver were in his first form, a simple SPI driver, how you will make a
dtsi file for an IP like this? You will add two nodes for the same IP
in dtsi and will take care to enable correct node in dts?
I think this driver is only a tradeoff between having an ugly hack in
kernel or having an messy device tree.

Can you give me an example please?
I am open to suggestions.

Sorry for that acked-by. There was a lot of "reviewed-by", "acked-by",
etc in a single version and I messed up :).

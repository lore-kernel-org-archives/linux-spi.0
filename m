Hrm, I would say that we need to push everyone to use the new API. sa11=
x0
should not be a big deal to fix IMHO and other users should be reasonab=
ly
simple to convert.

And the aim anyway is to convert everything to DT, right?

Sounds feasible for OMAP and daVinci and for others as well. I think ;)
I would go with this if someone asks my opinion :D

The core change to add the new API + the dma_map support should be pret=
ty
straight forward. It can live alongside with the old API and we can pha=
se out
the users of the old one.
The legacy support would need more time since we need to modify the arc=
h codes
and the corresponding DMA drivers to get the map registered, but after =
that
the remaining drivers can be converted to use the new API.

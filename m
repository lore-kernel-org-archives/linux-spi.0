Hi guys,

so what happens here is:
1/ we put display-subsystem dt node before spi node, which cause 
rockchip drm driver probed before spi(also before edp driver/vop driver...)

2/ rockchip drm driver bound after spi/edp/vop... drivers probed

3/ in rockchip drm driver's resume callback, it would try to enable edp 
panel backlight(through spi), but spi master is still suspended, then we 
got these errors:

1970-01-01T08:02:59.607315+08:00 ERR kernel: [  178.754005] cros-ec-spi

so other than move spi master suspend to late suspend, maybe we could 
defer rockchip drm driver probe after it's component drivers somehow?

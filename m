I tried various settings in .max_speed_hz from the original 6.6 MHt to
10 MHz and 13MHz as maximum of the controller. Did also not change
anything for me.

That reminds me that after defining DEBUG in pxa2xx_spi it did always
report 13MHz to me. Need to have a look at it.

You mean with request_threaded_irq()? (Seems there is no config option
for it) No, I'm not using it neither did I modify the pxa2xx_spi
driver to use it.

Thanks for the informations about PIO happen in the interrupt handler.
We already suspected that DMA might come with some overhead and for
our smallish register access we did not need it. Sadly .enable_dma = 0
did not make any difference. Will have another look into this.

I'm on 2.6.38 here btw. But the pxa2xx_spi driver did not get mayn
updates since then. The only commit that may be interested  is this
one:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=850a28ecd8044ef36b2c7699d2e3736a410b4d0a

Its either 8bit or 16bit for a message. The mentioned problem happens
on a 8 bit message. It does nothing else then writing to a defined
register address to trigger the hardware sending the data in the FIFO.

The FIFO reading and writing has no time critical elements here and
gets pre-filled.

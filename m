Arnd, thanks for your comments.

So we seem to agree, that one MBus window per SPI controller is the
way to go. Only how should this be described in the DT? I've come up
with these new DT properties in v2:

+- da-reg : The physical memory area that will be used for the direct
+           access mode, if enabled in one of the SPI devices.
+
+Per SPI device:
+- da-target-attribute : The target and attribute value for a specific
+                        SPI-controller / SPI-device combination.
+			E.g. <0x01 0x5e>: SPI0-CS1 target and attribute

...

+Example with direct access mode:
+	spi@10600 {
+		compatible = "marvell,orion-spi";
+		status = "okay";
+		da-reg = <0xf2000000 0x100000>;
+
+		spi-fpga@1 {
+			compatible = "altera,stratix-v";
+			reg = <1>;
+			/* 0x01 0x5e: SPI0-CS1 target and attribute */
+			da-target-attribute = <0x01 0x5e>;
+		};
+	};

I've added the "da-*" (Direct Access) properties to enable the
SPI driver to dynamically allocate the MBus windows. Do you find
these new bindings reasonable? Or do you have better suggestions for
this per-SPI-device dynamic MBus allocation, perhaps by using
MBUS_ID somehow?

Thanks,
Stefan

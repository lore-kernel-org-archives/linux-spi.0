It's probably slower to set up DMA for 2-byte commands but it might
work nonetheless.

I will give it a go.

Yes, when the DMA transfer fails the next command fails due to garbage
lying around. However, you can unload the SPI NOR driver, load spidev
driver, and read enough garbage to empty the fifos. Then the flash
identifies as normal again and you can access it.

When the flash is not seated properly and acts autistic you get all
0xff or all 0 back whatever you send to it, obvously. The
identification by the SPI NOR driver fails then.

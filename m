I was converting a few more drivers to use the proposed approach in this
RFC, in order to identify all outstanding issues we need to deal with,
and specifically for UFS, I end up with this exact scenario where UFS already
has an existing power domain (gdsc) and I need to add another one (rpmhpd) for
setting the performance state.

If I use dev_pm_opp_of_add_table() to add the opp table from DT, the opp
layer assumes its the same device on which it can do a dev_pm_genpd_set_performance_state()
with, however the device that's actually associated with the pm_domain when we
have multiple power domains is infact the one (dummy) that we create when
the driver makes a call to dev_pm_domain_attach_by_name/id().

Any thoughts on whats a good way to handle this?

[ Upstream commit 7251953d784baf7e5416afabe030a0e81de1a938 ]

The Freescale MPC8xxx had a special quirk for handling a
single hardwired chipselect, the case when we're using neither
GPIO nor native chip select: when inspecting the device tree
and finding zero "cs-gpios" on the device node the code would
assume we have a single hardwired chipselect that leaves the
device always selected.

This quirk is not handled by the new core code, so we need
to check the "cs-gpios" explicitly in the driver and set
pdata->max_chipselect = 1 which will later fall through to
the SPI master ->num_chipselect.

Make sure not to assign the chip select handler in this
case: there is no handling needed since the chip is always
selected, and this is what the old code did as well.

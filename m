It should be implemented.  The mmc_spi driver basically requires this.  Refer to this
comment in the mmc_spi driver:

 * - We tell the controller to keep the chipselect active from the
 *   beginning of an mmc_host_ops.request until the end.  So beware
 *   of SPI controller drivers that mis-handle the cs_change flag!
 *
 *   However, many cards seem OK with chipselect flapping up/down
 *   during that time ... at least on unshared bus segments.

I agree.  But existing ep93xx designs, the EDB93xx boards and Sim.One for
instance, use the SFRMOUT either directly for the chip select or as part of
the logic generating the chip select.  If possible it would be nice to handle
this.

I'll try to test this later.  The driver Ryan and I had used polling and it
worked but I think there was a race condition in it which occasionally broke
the transfer.

I think you would need to:

1. detect when all the transmit data in a transfer has been sent to the fifo
2. if there is another transfer pending, and a cs_change has not been requested,
   get it and start pumping it's transmit data into the fifo
3. read the remaining data for the first transfer then complete it
4. the pending transfer, which is already started, becomes the current transfer

Does this sound reasonable?

Hartley

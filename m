A SMP system, which SA1100 is not.

With audio on the SA1100, we have to keep both DMA transfer buffer
pointers filled to ensure that audio does not suffer.  I don't see
submitting multiple SPI transfers into the SPI subsystem would be
able to do that without waiting for the previous transfer to stop
completely before starting the next - and that implies the DMA
transfer completes before starting to program up the next one.

What I'm saying is that SPI will want DMA activity to complete _and_
end before it starts on the next transfer, which is going to create
a break in the data output.

Given that audio here just requires the SSP to be configured, and
then everything else is just DMA, I don't see why we need to waste
cycles fiddling with the SPI subsystem with its inherent batching
of transfers.

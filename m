Currently the edmacc_param struct is used by arch/arm/common/edma.c,
drivers/dma/edma.c and the sound/soc/davinci/davinci-pcm.c

For now this has to be in a global header file. Even with my local VIP bran=
ch
where I had removed the davinci-pcm already the two drivers for edma needs
this in global header file.
I can assure you, it will be gone (along with the arch/arm/common/edma.c) b=
ut
not right away.

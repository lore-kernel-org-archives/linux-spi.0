Just a small note for those who don't know max31x0. There are just 2
instructions to tx/rx data: simple data rx (in which we read one data
from the fifo (the data is valid if R status bit is set), control
lines (CTS) and status bits) and a combined tx/rx (like before but we
also send one byte (if the T status bit the char will be accepted) and
set control lines (RTS)). Every of these instructions is 2 bytes long.
It's a full SPI message (so you have to assert CS before and de-assert
it afterwards to make it work). TX buffer is just 1 byte deep, RX one
is 8 bytes.

Unfortunately we cannot batch TX if SPI speed (in chars going in /
time unit) is higher than the baud rate of serial communication. We
need to check that T bis is asserted before sending a char, otherwise
it is lost. For low baud rates doing this means monopolizing the bus.
And there is a subtle problem if we reduce SPI speed to the UART baud
rate: we can ask only for a maximum speed on the SPI. In case this is
lower the one we asked (maybe because of SPI clock divisors) and we do
a TX batch big enough we could not be emptying the RX FIFO fast enough
and so we risk to loose chars in a full duplex operation (*).

We could do batch RX operation but perhaps we are just transferring
bytes for nothing because we don't know in advance if the R bit is
set. And we cannot interleave TX and RX like current drivers do
because we are forced to use the simple rx operation and not the
combined rx/tx.

There's another point about batching: single instructions are complete
SPI messages. Many SPI master drivers I worked with (S3C24xx, AT91
because of a bug in the hardware) manage CS as a normal gpio. Another
problem here is that many devices require a configurable delay on CS
change (see delay_usecs field of spi_transfer) which is not handle by
hardware and so the drivers must somehow break a SPI messages in
single transfers and do something at the end of every one of these. So
even we batch 10 tx/rx instructions I really don't think many SPI
master controllers will be able to do a DMA of 20 bytes. Anyway I
agree that if we find a way of doing batching it's a good thing
because better controllers can benefit.

if we somehow manage to batch a TX of n bytes and after the first one
CTS changes we are going to send n-1 chars anyway. OK, maybe our peer
de-asserted CTS when still having n-1 byes of buffer free and somehow
higher layer protocols will recover. So I agree this could be not so
worrisome. But we should keep n small enough.

My concern is expressed above (*). Perhaps it's me missing some point.
To make it clear: I'm more than happy to test a driver that takes
another approach and switch to it if it's better (but it has to have
support of multiple instances and a fair usage of SPI bandwidth at
least). But I really don't see a reliable way of adding batching of
tx/rx. And I think it will be better to provide a patch to the current
driver than to rewrite it completely.

Hi all,

I've just discussed with Richard and Boris and AFAIK, nothing is planned
at the UBIFS side to replace vmalloc'd buffers by kmalloc'd buffers.
There are reasons for using vmalloc() but Richard can explain better
than me :)

Also, depending on the cache model used by Atmel SoCs, the spi-atmel.c
driver may suffer from the same issue too: using spi_map_buf() hence
mapping vmalloc'ed buffers for DMA usage will be OK with ARM Cortex A5
(PIPT data cache, so no cache aliasing issue at all) hence with SAMA5
series but is not OK for some older cores like ARM926 (VIVT data cache)
hence the SAM9 series.

So to fix the spi-atmel.c driver when used with SAM9 SoCs, we are
thinking about sending a first patch to simply disable the use of DMA
transfers on SAM9 SoCs in case of vmalloc'ed buffers and use CPU
transfers instead.
The code will be left unchanged for SAMA5 SoCs so there would be no
performance loss on those SoCs.
It won't be optimal on SAM9 SoCs but at least it would work.

Then in a new series, if nobody has started to work on this topic yet,
we could propose a generic solution using a bounce buffer at the SPI
core level. however we first need to think how we could do this.

Best regards,

Cyrille

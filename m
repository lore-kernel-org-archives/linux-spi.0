I think this suggestion is feasible: that we might merge this driver
even if it doesn't try to fit to some (still vague) idea of what a "SPI
NOR framework" should be. However, I don't know if the latter argument
is valid; just because it's in real products doesn't mean we really want
it as-is. But I think that in this case, the perfect may be the enemy of
the good -- the "good" driver now is better than the "perfect" driver
that never comes.

I'll hold you to that! Do we have any collateral for that guarantee? ;)

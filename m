Thank you very much for your response. As you might have gathered, I seem to
have it working but your feedback is really appreciated. I hope to do another
run of these boards with these fixes.

You are absolutely right. I don't know how I missed that. I just reworked my
existing board and it seems to be fine now. A very good find. Thanks a ton.

Well, thankfully at least one of the channels works. Unfortunately, I somehow
managed to replace one of the 10k resistors with a 1 ohm, so it's possible that
one of the level shifters on this board is fried. Naturally, I've been sampling
all of my parts thusfar and only now realized that the MAX1303 is unavailable
through the traditional channels (e.g. Digikey, Newark).

Yep, it is.

Very good point. I really should be a little more careful about this.

You are right. I had a remarkably difficult time sourcing level shifters for
this project at first because I wasn't intending on getting a PCB made. For
this reason, I standardized on TSSOP packages, which I could easily get DIP
adapters for. I've since realized that getting a PCB made is definitely worth
it.

Ouch, you are definitely right. Screwed that up.

Yep, I went with these because they were available in TSSOP.

All things considering, I think it might be time to start off with a clean
slate. This was an interesting first draft, but I think the constraints it was
designed within are largely inapplicable now.

TI has some very nice converters that will operate directly on 1.8V signals,
which would cut the chip count in half. Unfortunately they are in QFN packages,
which seem difficult at best to solder by hand. On the other hand, there are
also many higher-channel count TSSOP parts that look pretty enticing, although
none of them seem to operate at 1.8V.

I was hoping to finish this design up over the Spring break (now), but I guess
our data-taking will just have to wait. Arg.

Thanks a ton for your help. It's far too easy to overlook your own mistakes.

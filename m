I see. I'm still not convinced that this is the route to take,
however. It seems like this virtual gpio interface is not only pretty
clunky (simple board file glue turns into an entire gpio chip driver),
it seems like this is a very inaccurate and not very useful way to
expose a multiplexed CS configuration; e.g. what is this chip driver to
do if the user tries to set two CS pins at once? Is there precedent for
using the GPIO subsystem in this way?

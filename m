Correct.

I see. With this series I did not planed to fix all edma related issues, ju=
st
as a start clean up the related header files. I would rather not add fixes =
to
mmc, spi, etc drivers since while you have valid point it is not in the sco=
pe
of this series.
Can we do the changes you are suggesting in an incremental manner?

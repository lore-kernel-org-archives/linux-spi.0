Ah, actually it did get applied as a fix - it's just that I didn't send
a pull request before v4.3 got released.  Looking at what's there I
wasn't comfortable with the volume of fixes that arrived and never got
round to picking out those that were most urgent.  Sorry, these things
do happen from time to time I'm afraid especially when I'm travelling,
if something is urgent it's good to verify around -rc6 or so.

That's not in the changelog which is all I have after the patch is
applied (and what I was looking at since I just pulled the commit up by
ID).  If something is in Linus' tree it's often helpful to say
"...introduced in v4.2-rc1" or similar in the changelog.  Though in this
case it wasn't the issue.

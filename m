Hi Vignesh,

Sorry for the late review. I did not have time to review much back when
you submitted your first RFCs for this.

Is this API really sufficient? There are actually quite a few other
flash-related parameters that might be relevant to a controller. I
presume you happen not hit them because of the particular cases you're
using this for right now, but:

 * How many I/O lines are being used? These can vary depending on the
   type of flash and the number of I/O lines supported by the controller
   and connected on the board.

 * The previous point can vary across parts of the message. There are
   various combinations of 1/2/4 lines used for opcode/address/data. We
   only support a few of those combinations in m25p80 right now, but
   you're not specifying any of that in this API. I guess you're just
   making assumptions? (BTW, I think there are others having problems
   with the difference between different "quad" modes on Micron flash; I
   haven't sorted through all the discussion there.)

   There are typically both flash device and SPI controller constraints
   on this question, so there needs to be some kind of negotiation
   involved, I expect. Or at least, the SPI master needs to expose which
   modes it can support with this flash-read API.

Also, this API doesn't actually have anything to do with memory mapping.
It has to do with the de facto standard flash protocol. So I don't think
mmap belongs in the name; it should be something about flash. (I know of
at least one other controller that could probably use this API, excpet
it doesn't use memory mapping to accomplish the accelerated flash read.)

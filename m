There is a big difference: MFD functions are(more or less) independent
functions, which can be used at the same time. It makes perfect sense for a
single IP block that has both SPI and UART interfaces, that can be used at
the same time.

In this case, there is a single piece of hardware that can perform
different functions, but not at the same time. Performing a different
function means configuring the hardware for that function, hence using a
different driver (from a different subsystem).

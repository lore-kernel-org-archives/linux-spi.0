This patch looks really nice. And, from my point of view, especially
because I don't see how it could introduce a regression for the existing
boards :)

As you don't submit any patch for the dtsi, I assume that you expect
that this part will be done at board level. In this case as I wrote
above we are sure that all the board continue working without any need
to test them.

That means that once the direct write mode is set in the device tree you
can't go back to the PIO mode. So, if I understand well, once you have
programmed a FPGA bitstream image into the FPGA you won't use this SPI
for a more standard communication. However, I don't know how to switch
from a mode to another in an elegant way (without adding an ioctl
command).

Yes. There is possibility that last transfer ->cs_change is set which can be used
by SPI controller drivers to keep the chip selected in case next message is going
to the same device.

However, I haven't implemented that as it is optional (but trivial to add afterwards).

Yes, unfortunately. SFRMOUT cannot be software controlled so it is
not suitable for general purpose chipselect. This was the sole
purpose of using GPIO lines for chipselects.

I'm not exactly sure but "polling" mode sounds something that could
work around that. It just need to be sure that it transmits
continuously to keep the SFRMOUT asserted.

You could try v3 of the driver with:
	# modprobe ep93xx-spi transfer_method=0

and see if it works there.

An alternative would be that interrupt handler schedules tasklet which then
takes next transfer immediately once current transfer is finished.

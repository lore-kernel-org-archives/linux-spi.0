Yes, it was intentional actually to not fall back to legacy lookup. Wit=
h the
dma_request_slave_channel_compat() I have had cases when the DT binding=
 was
not correct - or actually when trying to get deferred working that the =
code
would fall back to legacy mode and it got me a channel which is not usa=
ble.
I did not know that we have platforms booting in DT but the dma binding=
 is not
working so it uses other method to get channel.
I think, if we allow the fall back within dma_request_chan() it would n=
ot
cause the same issue as the dma_request_slave_channel_compat() did as l=
ong as
we are not providing the lookup table on DT booted cases when the DMA b=
inding
is working correctly.
Let me see the flow, but I think it is doable.

Hi Feng,

I'm really concerned with this driver.  I think it needs a lot more
work before it is ready for prime-time.  Again, you might want to
consider asking Greg to add it to the staging tree while you clean
stuff up and coordinate with the max3100 driver author.

Comments below.

Why the separate .h file?  If it isn't used by multiple .c files, then
it belongs in the .c file itself.

NAK.  I've looked at the max3100 driver, and the max3110 data sheet
specifically states that it is max3100 compatible.  I'm opposed to the
merging of this driver until you've at least made an attempt at
working with the max3100 driver author to produce a single driver.

Don't do this.  To start, it limits the driver to only ever being able
to handle a single instance of the device.  Some drivers use a fixed
size table instead, but that isn't any better either.

Instead of relying on a global variable, store the struct uart_max3110
pointer inside the spi_device.dev.p private data pointer.

=46or the console portion use the struct console.data pointer.

Why is this a module param?  Shouldn't this be determined on whether
or not the drivers pdata structure is populated with an irq number?

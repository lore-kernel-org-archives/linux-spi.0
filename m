no
"this is the width in bytes of the source (RX)register where DMA data 
shall be read. If the sourceis memory this may be ignored depending on 
architecture."
AFAIK is should be 1 byte for SPI side and seems to be ignored for 
memory side, but as soon as I don't know what should be correct value 
for memory side I just put 1 there too.

I did some tests before with 3/4 FIFO size but it didn't work and I got 
stuck with 1 byte.
It seems like 1 byte is the correct value because in SPI protocol we can 
only send 1 byte in 1 burst.

I can put more info in this log
but there is already a message printed from sun4_spi_dma_setup() if any 
error occurs

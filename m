Right, now that we have working OMAP in mainline again...

So, trying to figure this out... the result is not nice.

If the spi message has is_dma_mapped = false, then we potentially map the
DMA buffers against mcspi->dev.  This struct device is the same as the
master->dev.parent.

However, when we come to complete a transfer, we unmap them against the
spi_device's struct device - in other words a different device.

That's the reason for the warning.  However, when using DMA engine, both
of these struct device's are the wrong one to be using - the right one to
use is the one assocated with the DMA engine.

However, this presents a problem with transfers with is_dma_mapped = true.
SPI device drivers appear to assume that the right struct device to use
to map for DMA is master->dev.parent.  That's fine if your SPI master
device is the struct device performing the DMA, but with DMA engine
involved, this is not true.  Not sure at the moment what to do about
that one.

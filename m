Another thing to think about: this device is never going to be high
performance.  If tx gets delayed, then it isn't a big deal because
there won't be any data loss.  The real concern is RX where if you
don't process fast enough then characters get dropped.  Fortunately
you have an 8 byte deep buffer.  So if each timer fire schedules more
than one transfer (even if only one char is actually transmitted),
then it is okay if the timer granularity is 300-400us at 115200.

If you only use spi_async (which must be atomic), and you don't do any
heavy data processing or udelay()s in the irq path, then your driver
will not be adding major latency.  Use a ring buffer for both the tx
and rx paths so that the console processing can be done in a workqueue
or something and you should be just fine.

Then the SPI master driver is broken.  It must be fixed.  :-)
Submission of SPI transfers via spi_async() is supposed to always be
atomic.

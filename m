It's not specifically for SPI, it's the fact that you're asking every
single bus type which might be described in ACPI to handle both hotplug
and coldplug paths separately.  Given that the code that's being added
just seems like trivial boilerplate it seems like we're doing this
wrong, we should be factoring this out so there's nothing bus types can
get wrong.

Or perhaps the issue is that we can't make our mind up if the bus
specific code should go in the bus or in the ACPI core?

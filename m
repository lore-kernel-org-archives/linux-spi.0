I think you can try to implement the dirmap interface proposed here [1]
and use DMA+TRSFR_READ/WRITE_MEMORY for such direct mappings. This
should optimize path where we really matter about perfs.

The patch series is

Acked-by: Boris Brezillon <boris.brezillon@bootlin.com>

Mark, if you're okay with the new implementation, would you mind taking
those patches in the spi tree?

Thanks,

Boris

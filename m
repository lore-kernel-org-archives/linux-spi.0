    Like with EDMA we have nothing else to do with CPPI 4.1 being shared by 
DaVinci-like and OMAP-like SOCs. Thank TI for creatring this mess. And 
actually even that is not a good place since I think I know of a MIPS SoC 
having CPPI 4.1 as well, just out of tree.

    Unfortunately, Russell has done it -- all that was discuseed without me in 
the loop even. :-/

     I still disagree. IMO drivers/dma/ is for standalone DMA engines. Else we 
could stick every bus mastering device's DMA engines there. CPPI 4.1 is in 
design standlone DMA engine, despite all in-tree implementations having it as 
subblock of MUSB and serving only MUSB.

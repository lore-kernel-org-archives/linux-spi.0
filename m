Seems nothing :) If I understand code in __device_release_driver() right:
the .remove() callback will be called after pm_runtime_put_sync() and
device should be disabled at this moment.

Also, note that ti_qspi_setup() will be called for each SPI device attached
to SPI master and further PM management of SPI master is performed by SPI core
from __spi_pump_messages().

Yes, I'm seeing real problems, e.g. on the Galileo board when running
against a slower SPI device and using MSI: An interrupt is raised
because the TX queue was flushed towards the device (threshold
underrun). While handling that interrupt, the device starts to respond
and an RX event occurs as well. This raises the related interrupt reason
before the TX source was satisfied. Therefore, the interrupt output of
the SPI master will never go down, and there will be no additional edge
generated. Using level-interrupts, this is no problem, but with
edge-triggered we get stuck.

   Utter nonsense, CPPI 4.1 is hardware abstract DMA engine. It's used for
Ethernet transfers on out-of-tree platforms like mach-avalanche/.

   My efforts stopped to be funded by MV back in 2010. Hell, I'm not even
working in MV as I used to, hanging on the verge of my current contract being
terminated.

   There was a patch, it only needed comments addressed. I think the author was
Heikki Krogerus. As for me, my time is very limited, so be thankful even for
those scarce patches I'm sending out now -- I'm doing them in my copious free time.

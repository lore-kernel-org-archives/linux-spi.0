I'm sorry to say I really haven't had the time to review that properly.
I'm also not sure it is a true dependency for your series, as you're
tackling different pieces of the puzzle. So it's mostly just a conflict,
not a real direct help.

So unless I'm misunderstanding, I'd suggest submitting MTD stuff against
the latest l2-mtd.git (or linux-next.git; l2-mtd.git is included there),
and I'll let you know if conflicts come up that need fixing.

Hi

DW controller driver don't need max3110 driver to use big spi transfer,
the early version of our max3110 is also one word per spi transfer mode,
and the 2 drivers work fine, though the rx performance is not good (copy
& paste a bulk message to console).

Let me use some example to explain why I use big spi transfer for 3110:

When the HW works at 230400 bps, when we copy bulk data to the console,
max3110 will probably receive about 20K characters, so the time for
handling each char is 50us. If you use one char per spi transfer, it
will have to execute 20K spi_transfer in one second, and each need be
done in 50us, in this 50us you'll have to deal with controller IRQ 
handler + spi system overhead + tty receiving overhead. Is it a little
over-killing to use one char per spi transfer? while the HW does
have a 8 words RX FIFO

The output is not so slow as input, if we set the console=/dev/ttyMAX0,
the output is sluggish, looks like below, but when enter command line
console the output is smooth, while the input is very slow.

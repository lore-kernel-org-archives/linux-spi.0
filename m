Add get_buf, put_buf api support in spi master.
This can be used in a scenario where spi controller
supports memory mapped operations(typically with flash devices).
So, the memcpy needs top be done in slave devices which need the
required memory mapped address. These api can be used to get that
master address.

These can also be used to turm the master controller clock, as usually
the clocks get turned in spi core. But, in memory mapped case, we will
bypass the spi core and hence needa way out to turn on the controller clock.

Add configure from slave api, which can be used to configure the master
controller with slave specific information.

Add slave info struct, that can be filled with slave  properties required by
master controller for its register configuration.

v1->v2:
- Added a slave info structure.
- Merge all other header related patches into this.

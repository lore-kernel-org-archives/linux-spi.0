These things being constant for a given flash?

Presumably if it's done via memcpy() it won't go direct to RAM but
rather be bounced through the CPU which is a bit interesting for
performance (it might help, but it does mean that there's a core stalled
waiting for the flash which might not be the best use of resources if
there's other things it can be getting on with).  With DMA it'd be a
direct to memory transfer though.

DMA would definitely help here.

You don't *really* care if it's that specific user so much as that it's
that particular pattern.

You could, however, expose an explicit flash mapping interface for this
functionality.  That does seem like it's going to be an awful lot easier=20
and help with keeping things like DMA support out of the driver and in
the core (which would be useful if there's other controllers with the
same functionality, I seem to recall that there are).

Again, it doesn't matter if it's actually a read command only that it's
got a compatible format on the bus.

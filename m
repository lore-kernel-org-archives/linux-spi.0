You probably need both - there's often a hard limit where the FIFO size
in the hardware becomes a limit for DMA as well as a soft limit on top
of that for performance reasons.

Exposing it as a sysfs or debugfs file might make more sense if you were
going to do this.  Is that required after merge though?  It seems like
this is something where we've perhaps been tuning the wrong parameter
(transfer size instead of runtime), or need to investigate dynamic
tuning.

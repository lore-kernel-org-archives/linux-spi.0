This patch set adds Device Tree support for IRQ, SPI, I2C and GPIO on
Orion based drivers, and makes use of these for kirkwood devices.  It
also adds the ability to boot QNAP TS219 based systems using device
tree.

The SPI DT patches are from Michael Walle, and have been previously
posted. I've addressed the issues raised during the review.

The SPI refactor to use the SPI framework was submitted for merge into
3.5, but due to dependency issues, which are now resolved, the patch
was not accepted. This patch has been modified to remove two NOP
functions, which the SPI framework no longer needs.

Andrew Lunn (5):
  ARM: Kirkwood: Add interrupt controller support for DT boards
  SPI: Refactor spi-orion to use SPI framework queue.
  I2C: MV64XXX: Add Device Tree support
  ARM: Kirkwood: Add DT support for GPIO controllers
  Kirkwood: Add basic device tree support for QNAP TS219.

Michael Walle (4):
  spi-orion: remove uneeded spi_info
  spi-orion: add device tree binding
  ARM: kirkwood: use devicetree for orion-spi
  ARM: kirkwood: use devicetree for SPI on dreamplug

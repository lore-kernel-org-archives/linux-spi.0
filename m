Yes, but now its only used in a clamp function, where I should
provide the exact value 4096. Will use your previous suggestion.
#define    QSPI_FRAME_MAX            0x1000

hmm..got the point.
I will pass the count address also to ti_qspi_read_data/write_data and make
use of the switch statement to decrement the count.

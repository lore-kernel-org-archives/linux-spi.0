That's necessary IMO.

Ironically enough, we also have this problem in ACPI where there are power
resources that "regular" devices may depend on in pretty much the same way
as discussed here.  Those power resources are represented as devices, so the
problem is really analogous.

In ACPI, though, basically all devices are registered by the same routine that
walks the namespace (which is a tree-like structure) and registers all devices
it finds there.  Before registering a device it examines its properties and,
among other things, it finds what power resources the device depends on.  Then,
it may invoke itself in a recursive way to register those power resources before
registering the device (the recurrence is one-level only, because power
resources cannot depend on anything else).  Since the driver for power
resources has been already registered at that point, we know it will bind to
the power resource device objects as soon as they are registered.  This is done
in a patch series I posted yesterday, actaully.

I'm not sure if this approach can be generalized somehow, but in the ACPI
case it works just fine.

Thanks,
Rafael

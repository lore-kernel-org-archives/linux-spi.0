But it really does not matter. The amba-pl022.c driver has all the same
deviations for things called "PL023" that are not pure PL022 either.
I just made the driver a bit more flexible, supporting both.

If the people doing drivers/usb/musb/* had done the same thing we
would have had what, 5 drivers for similar hardware?

But I knew, having just written the needed extensions to dmaengine.
And I said so. But I realize I'm maybe not considered an authoritative
source on the subject, and I'm biased.

I disagree because it's IMO at first sight no more deviant than our "PL023"
variants that still use the same pl022 driver.

Is there some inexepensive hardware with EP93xx I can get to fix this
myself?

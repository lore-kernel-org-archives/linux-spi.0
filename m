spi-mtk-nor is a driver to replace mtk-quadspi and they have almost
the same device-tree bindings. Reuse this binding documentation and
convert it for new driver:

1. "Mediatek SoCs" -> "Mediatek ARM SoCs" because MTK MIPS SoCs
   use different controllers.
2. document "interrupts" as a required property because it's
   available on all SoCs with this controller and new driver takes
   advantages of it. It's implemented as optional only to maintain
   backward compatibility.
3. replace binding example with a mt7629 one because this is the
   only one I know the interrupt assignment.

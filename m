TI QSPI controller has SFI translator which exposes entire flash memory
as memory mapped region for read. With this interface, the CPU
can copy data from flash using normal memcpy call. SFI translator
takes care of generating appropriate SPI signals to read data from
flash. This interface works only with SPI flash memories and cannot be
used with other SPI devices.
Introduce use_mmap_read field in spi_message struct. This can be set by
mtd devices (m25p80) to indicate to spi-master (ti-qspi) to perform
memory mapped read. This helps to distinguish whether the spi-message is
from mtd layer(hence mmap read is possible) or by other spi devices.

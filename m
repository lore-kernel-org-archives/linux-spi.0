I spammed Freescale with service requests.

The SPI clock (aka. sampling clock of the SCK line).

The problem is the SPI block in slave mode ignores SS being pulled back up.

SPI slave is hard because you can not anticipate the amount of data you will 
receive. You can not anticipate when you will receive those either.

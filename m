but if you want to reference the filter function (which is in
drivers/dma/edma.c) in arch/arm/mach-davinci/ directory, we will need it.
Don't we?

If I leave the header as it is, then how would we clean up the edma headers=
? I
would not put the API definitions for the arch code into the same file as we
have the filter definition.

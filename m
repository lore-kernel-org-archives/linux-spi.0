Thanks for the quick reply. Is giving an interrupt on both press and 
release a requirement for gpio-keys? or is there another setup that I'm 
not aware of?

How does the gpio-key framework work with register mapped GPIOs that are 
rising-edge or falling-edge triggered? I tend to think of these IRQ 
states as the general case for GPIO.

Thanks

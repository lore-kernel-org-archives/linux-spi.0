I noticed it only with v4.5-rc1 and bisected it to commit 5de85b9d57ab
("PM / runtime: Re-init runtime PM states at probe error and driver
unbind") as it broke my PM tests for n900. For Linux next probably
was also broken for before that for some time.

Unfortunately based on the regressions I'm chasing every merge window
I'm suspecting that very few people are actually testing PM runtime
with mainline Linux kernel. Or they don't have the PM runtime fully
implemented in the mainline kernel for their devices. This is at
least for the SoC PM use case.

Ulf is working on a generic PM runtime test driver :) I'm hoping we
can then use that for basic regression testing on in an arch
independent way.

Tony

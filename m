Just sent a test patch for this, completely untested given the hour but
hopefully you can give it a spin if this is easy to reproduce for you.

Rich, I also just noticed that you didn't CC any people on any of your
postings prior to today.  As I know we've discussed before you should
*always* directly CC at least maintainers, you can not assume that
anyone is going to see anything that is only on the lists.  This was the
same reason why your top posted content free pings didn't get anywhere,
most likely none of the maintainers had seen any of your emails.

Great!

Same results.

I hacked your driver to allow me to toggle a gpio when the interrupt routine
starts and exits.

I captured the 4 byte write/2 byte read caused by the spi_write_then_read in
the sst25l driver when it does the Read-ID command.  The chip select goes low
followed by the first 4 byte transfer of the message due to the fifo's getting
primed.  This transfer actually doesn't finish since the rx data has not been
received.  So the interrupts just get enabled as normal.

The data starts transferring when the first byte is placed in the tx fifo.  It
takes about 4.45us to send/receive the 4 bytes.  Approximately 15.9us after the
last byte has been received the interrupt routine starts.  It then takes about
5.7us for the second 2 byte transfer to start.  So there is a total of about
21.6us between the two transfers where SFRM is deasserted.

Let me know if you want the picture posted.

On the first read/write for a transfer this condition can never succeed.

The ep93xx_spi_read_write function first empties the rx fifo then fills the
tx fifo.  Putting any data in the tx fifo means that you are going to have to
come back to empty the rx fifo.

So, the block below never executes.

Even if the first read/write did succeed you are not starting the second transfer.
This is just passing the operation off to the interrupt routine using the second
transfer in the message.

Here the N transfer has been completed and we are trying to continue with the N+1
transfer.  This should work but I need to figure out a way to capture it with my
logic analyzer.  The only problem is if the N transfer is complete that means the
tx and rx fifos are empty so the SFRM signal is going to be deasserted.  The N+1
transfer might start really soon after but there will still be a glitch in the SFRM
signal.

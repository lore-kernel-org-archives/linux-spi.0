The patch

   spi: spi-qcom-qspi: Use device managed memory for clk_bulk_data

has been applied to the spi tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/spi.git for-5.6

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] spi: spi-qcom-qspi: Use device managed memory for
 clk_bulk_data

Currrently the memory for the clk_bulk_data of the QSPI controller
is allocated with spi_alloc_master(). The bulk data pointer is passed
to devm_clk_bulk_get() which saves it in clk_bulk_devres->clks. When
the device is removed later devm_clk_bulk_release() is called and
uses the bulk data referenced by the pointer to release the clocks.
For this driver this results in accessing memory that has already
been freed, since the memory allocated with spi_alloc_master() is
released by spi_controller_release(), which is called before the
managed resources are released.

Use device managed memory for the clock bulk data to fix the issue
described above.

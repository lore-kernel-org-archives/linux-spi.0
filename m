Sorry for being unclear, I was referring to spi writes here, not flash
writes.

The MTD infrastructure handles _point internally, and I think it is
only ever used on jffs2 these days. I had assumed that _point was
used by mtd_block to implement direct_access for read-only block
based file systems as well, but it's not.

I don't think there is any device that abstracts a SPI-NOR flash
to look like RAM.

It's not impossible, it's just that IIRC we decided that the effort
to do this well was not reasonable compared to the benefit back
when the mbus driver got added.

I don't think anything has changed here.

Ok, good. Then let's just do the SPI host driver like all the other
mbus slaves using whatever mbus provides, and implement dynamic remapping
of mbus windows whenever someone gets too annoyed with having to 
come up with a mapping for their board.

At least by doing SPI like all the other devices, we don't make it
harder to come up with a generic algorithm for assigning the windows
at boot time.

Okay, switching back to the normal ioremap.

Yes, this is also my feeling. While implementing this 0xffffffff
size in the SPI controller 'reg' DT node, I just stumbled over the
following problem: The resulting size of the area to map
(of_address_to_resource) is not the minimum of the 'soc' 'ranges'
entry and this 0xffffffff as I would have expected. But its always
0xffffffff. Do you know if this is general problem with this
approach or perhaps a problem / bug in the DT address probing /
translation?

Thanks,
Stefan

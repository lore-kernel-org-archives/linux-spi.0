This API communicates whatever data is currently communicated via
spi_message through spi_sync/transfer_one interfaces.

How is the spi controller currently being made aware of this via
m25p80_read / spi_sync() interface? AFAIK, mode field of spi_device
struct tell whether to do normal/dual/quad read but there is no info
communicated wrt 1/2/4 opcode/address/data combinations. And there is no
info indicating capabilities of spi-master wrt no of IO lines for
opcode/address/data that it can support.

If spi-master capabilities are known then spi_mmap_read_supported() (or
a new function perhaps) can be used for negotiation. These capabilities
can be added incrementally once ability to specify spi-master
capabilities are in place.

As far as TI QSPI controller is concerned, the accelerated read happens
via mmap port whereby a predefined memory address space of SoC is
exposed as QSPI mmap region. This region can be accessed like normal
RAM(via memcpy()) and the QSPI controller interface takes care of
fetching data from flash on SPI bus automatically hence, I named it as
above. But, I have no hard feelings if it needs to be generalized to
spi_mtd_read() or something else.

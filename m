Hi Lee,

I saw that the patches were not applied to your tree for this kernel 
version. After the discussion with Nicolas, I remember that you said 
that you will take the patches in your tree. I addressed Mark comments 
related to the last version of patches. Is there something that must be 
reworked in order to take the patches?

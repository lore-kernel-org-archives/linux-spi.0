[cc'ing Rafael and Greg since they are certain to be interested in
this discussion]

It's a good start.  However, I think it can be done more generically

To start, I'm not a fan of matching by name.  It's fragile because it
makes assumptions about how devices will be names when they actually
appear (ie. Sometimes .id is dynamically assigned).  Ideally I'd
prefer to have direct references (ie. pointers) to the devices that
need to be registered, which *shouldn't* be difficult to handle.  That
guarantees that the correct device is always referenced.  (aside: the
device-tree use case provides this information by having direct
'phandle' references between dependencies.)

Also, any dependency tracking must work across bus_types.  It is not
sufficient to only handle the platform_devices use-case.  All bus
types have this need.

I see a few potential approaches.

Option 1: Add a list of prerequisite devices to struct device and
modify driver core so that it defers binding to a driver until all the
prerequisites are already bound.  This can probably be implemented
in a way that works for all bus types transparently.  Before binding
a driver, the driver core would increase the ref count on each of the
prereq devices, and decrease it again when the driver is removed.

Option 2: On a per-bus_type basis have a separate registration and the
bus type code would hold the device unregistered in a pending list.
This option would also add a prerequisites list to struct device.

Option 3: Don't try to handle it in the bus_type or driver core code
at all, but rather provide board support code with helpers to make
waiting for other devices easy.  Even in this case I think it is
probably still a good idea for the dependant devices to increment
the refcount of the prereq devices.

Perhaps something that is used like:

void do_second_registration(void)
{
	/* register list of dependant devices */
}

and then in the primary registration function:
	...
	device_notify_when_bound(&prereq_pdev->dev,
				 do_second_registration);
	platform_device_add(prereq_pdev);
	...

which would reduce the boilerplate, but remain flexible.  However,
while flexable, option 3 doesn't solve the dependency tracking
problem, and it still requires some gymnastics to handle multiple
dependencies.

On a related issue, it may also be desirable for each device to
maintain a list of devices that have claimed dependency on it for the
purpose of debugability.

...

unfortunately it also means that the device is in limbo between when
it is "registered" by board support code, and when it is actually
registered.  ie. It won't show up in sysfs.

Unfortunately this approach means the board support code will never
know if there is a problem with registering the device.

If it is part of the core platform_bus_type code, then there is no
need to use a notifier.  The hook can be added directly.

Hi Octavian,

Apologies for missing this earlier, just catching up on this thread...

This sounds very useful during development. However, and using EFI
variables isn't so terrible, but I am concerned that this should be
standardized through ASWG and at least involve certain other OS vendors
so that the variable (GUID) can be captured somewhere. If not in the
spec itself, then it should be captured as an external ACPI resource on
the UEFI website with a clear pointer to the exact IDs to be used.

Can you confirm that's the intention? i.e. that you're allowing a
command line option for specifying the ID now because you intend to go
ensure that there is a standard one that everyone will use later?

I should check (but maybe you know) if the kernel is automatically
tainted by this codepath as well?

Thanks,

Jon.

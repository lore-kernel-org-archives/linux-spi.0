Ugh, this isn't dwc3-usb all over again, is it?

That sound like it could do with more investigation before piling hacks
on top of hacks. In theory, that would force dma_alloc_*() to always
fail, whilst allowing dma_map_*() to still work - I imagine the actual
SPI block is just a plain AXI master, meaning there oughtn't to be any
fundamental difference between coherent and streaming DMA, but there can
be differences in whatever functionality those API uses represent in the
driver/SPI code (e.g. data buffers vs. control descriptors).

AFAICS from a quick scan of the driver, that would be the correct thing
to do - in general for a platform device, the guy described in the DT
should be the guy being passed to DMA API calls.

Following what I mentioned above, "git grep dma_alloc drivers/spi" makes
it seem like coherent DMA isn't used anywhere relevant, which is rather
puzzling. Unless of course somewhere along the line somebody's done the
dev->dma_mask = &dev->dma_coherent_mask hack, with the result that
writing one mask hits both, making *all* DMA fail and big transfers fall
back to PIO.

And as a backup review comment in case any of the above musings go
nowhere; at the very least please use dma_set_coherent_mask() rather
than open-coding it ;)

Hi,

the main goal of the patchset is to support SPI cnnected device
without CS line link.

The first two patches make the s3c64xx driver to consider the
case of a disconnected CS line. This is done by adding a property
in the DTS ("no-cs-readback") which informs the device driver the
absence of a chip selection link.

The last three patches are just some code re-work and
beautification.

Changelog: V1 -> V2

 - the first version of the patchset was removing an 'if'
   statement on "!spi->chip_select" which was causing the SPI
   core to fail. In this case the drivers would have been able to
   set a chip_select = 0 in absence of a CS link. After a short
   discussion with Mark, this has been replaced, as described
   above, by a property in the DTS.

 - one more patch has been added which assigns to some variable
   the proper type

 - some typos fixed in the commit messages

Thanks,
Andi

No it doesn't. A spi_message consists of a list of spi_transfer's, and
each spi_transfer has tx_nbits and rx_nbits fields.

Yes there is. m25p80 fills out spi_transfer::rx_nbits. Currently, we
only use this for the data portion, but it's possible to support more
lines for the address and opcode portions too, using the rx_nbits for
the opcode and address spi_transfer struct(s) (currently, m25p80_read()
uses 2 spi_transfers per message, where the first one contains opcode +
address + dummy on a single line, and the second transfer receives the
data on 1, 2, or 4 lines).

For a true SPI controller, there is no need to specify something
different for opcode/address/data, since all those are treated the same;
they're just bits on 1, 2, or 4 lines. So the SPI_{TX,RX}_{DUAL,QUAD}
mode flags in struct spi_master tell m25p80 all it needs to know.

For generic SPI handling, these are already known. But now you're adding
flash-specific capabilities, and I'm not going to assume that all
accelerated-read (e.g., your TI mmap'ed flash read) support all the same
modes as your generic modes.

So, which modes does your mmap'ed read handle? 1/1/1? 1/1/2? 1/1/4?
4/4/4? (where x/y/z means x lines for opcode, y lines for address, and z
lines for data)

spi_master capabilities are already in place. So now you need to
describe them for your new interface too.

I understand all that, but the API as it currently stands is not tied to
that implementation at all.

Maybe spi_flash_read()? It's technically not limited to MTD, though it
probably would only be used there. (And please, don't tread on the
'spi_nor_' prefix, as we already have a related, but distinct, framework
using that.)

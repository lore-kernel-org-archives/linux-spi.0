(Sorry for the really laggy reply)

I don't see it being that big a deal.  gpio drivers are pretty
lightweight and it is fine to have domain-specific limitations on how
gpios for a particular "gpio controller" behave.  In your example, if
the hardware doesn't support enabling 2 CS pins at once, then you make
a choice, either setting one when the other is already set simply does
not work; or it could reset the other state.  Either choice would be
fine.  The SPI driver must do the right thing regardless and deselect
the previous CS line before enabling a new one.

The other alternative would be to implement a new SPI chipselect
common infrastructure, but IMO, that would just end up looking like a
duplication of the gpio infrastructure.

Regardless, my point still stands, platform callbacks for what amounts
to gpio manipulations doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

Yes, in drivers/spi look at mpc52xx_spi.c, davinci_spi.c, ath79_spi.c,
atmel_spi.c, and many more.  Grep for gpio in drivers/spi.

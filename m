At the end the aim is to get rid of the edma code form arch/arm and have on=
ly
dmaengine API towards eDMA. The ASoC davinci-pcm is the only user of the
legacy API AFAIK. It has a mode called ping-pong which is not possible with
the dmaeingine at all. This is to overcome underflow situations on parts wh=
ere
the audio IP does not have FIFO.
My edma-pcm (which is using dmaengine) should be able to handle this
situation, but I need to verify it before I can remove the davinci-pcm and
then we can get rid of the direct eDMA API and code.

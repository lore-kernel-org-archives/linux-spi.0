hmm.  This is odd.  We probably need to make the SPI subsystem aware of this.
It is possible to ask for exclusive use of an SPI bus and I think we should
be doing this here.  It may be wired low on your board, but it may be wired to
a controllable chip select on other boards and we can still force it low
to trigger this mode if it makes sense for the current application.
Datasheet says that this mode kicks in whenever we don't raise the cs rather
than it being a one time thing.

So I'd argue what we actually need to represent here is that the CS line
is not controllable.  What this means to the driver should be handled
in the driver - ideally also dealing with the case where it is controllable
appropriately (via exclusive bus usage).  Spi devices have the SPI_NO_CS
bit in the mode member of the spi device but I'm not sure about bindings.

Mark or other SPI people (cc'd) any thoughts on how to handle this cleanly?

For the runtime configurable ones, the vast majority of the time this should
not be exposed to userspace at all.  It's a fairly esoteric option and
exactly what it means varies hugely between different boards.  Most of the
time userspace has not idea what to do with it - if 'explicitly'
provided as a control.  It might make sense for a particular application
with tightly coupled userspace and kernelspace, but that's not what we
are targeting in IIO.

So it is up to the driver to make sensible decisions based on what is
going on.  Kind of like auto suspend for runtime pm.  

The one case where we normally want to flip to continuous modes is when
we have a chardev access going on to the device.  In IIO that reflects
the fact we are in a push mode rather than userspace polling for new data.

A lot of hardware supports continuous and one shot capture in this fashion!
Pretty much anything with an internal sequencing clock.

Personally I don't think we are in a position yet to make this a generic
property - this is the first device where it is actually to do with the
physical circuit (and arguably it isn't really - see above).

It might become common, but I actually think it unlikely. It's odd
to have a device that sits in the sweet spot between being dumb enough to
not make it software configurable and clever enough to implement this
stuff at all.

Reference voltages are an oddity as the supply naming typically should match
that on the datasheet. It's 'fairly' consistent but some devices
have a set of relatively obscure references to different parts of the
input circuitry.  We can document it as a 'default' assuming nothing
strange is going on though.  This is why we have the vagueness below
on VDD and VCC.

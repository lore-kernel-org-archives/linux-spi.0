Well, but do we need a zone for that purpose? The idea was to actually
replace the zone by a CMA pool (at least on x86). With the current
implementation of the CMA we would move the range [0-16M] pfn range into 
zone_movable so it can be used and we would get rid of all of the
overhead each zone brings (a bit in page flags, kmalloc caches and who
knows what else)

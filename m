Hi Yogesh,

I guess it's just a matter of taste, but I also prefer when all regs are
defined even if not all of them are used.

Hm, I don't get it. LUT_MODE was just a way to pass raw data on the I/O
bus, so the row vs column thing has no meaning in this case, and the
offset withing the QSPI AHB range should just be ignored.

And that's again flash specific details leaking into the spi-mem layer,
which I'd like to avoid (as repeated many times before).

Then you should really review my dirmap proposal instead of trying to
hack things directly into your driver. The only reason I did no send a
new version of the dirmap patchset is because I got no reviews from
people that might need it, so please have a look at it, try to
implement a backend for your controller, and let me know if you face
any issues or think things should be done differently.

Thanks,

Boris

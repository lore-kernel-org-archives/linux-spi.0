Thanks for the hint. I've tested again with devm_ioremap_wc() and the
resulting SPI TX time is identical to the one using the driver with
the uncached (non write-combined) mapping. This is most likely a
result of the already fully saturated SPI bus speed being the
bottle-neck here.

A bit more testing has shown, that using devm_ioremap_wc() leads
to sporadic failures in the FPGA image downloading though. Now
I'm unsure, if its really worth to add some cache flushing after
the memcpy() call here (flush_cache_vmap ?) or better keep the
uncached ioremap in place.

This is for the single-window mode, right? My comment above was
still referring to the original implementation. And yes, this
gets a bit complicated and is most likely not really necessary.
So I would prefer to keep the mapping fixed to a max. of 1MiB for
now.

Thanks. I've prepared a new version implementing this single-
window mode. Please let me know how you prefer the cache issue
above to be handled (uncached mapping, flush or ?) and I'll
update the patch accordingly.

Thanks,
Stefan

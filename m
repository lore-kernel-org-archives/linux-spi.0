Take the example of a long Rx-only transfer using vmalloc'ed buffer. The 
dummy Tx buffer will be a contiguous buffer (1 SG entry) and clock and 
dummy data will be continuous during the transfer with no pause. On the 
Rx side, the PaRAM entries needs to be reloaded after 20*4096 bytes 
Rx'ed. Handling the interrupt, reloading the PaRAM's and resuming DMA 
takes ~600 us. Since the slave is still transmitting, data will be lost, 
since the FIFO is only 1 word and 1 byte takes 8us @ 1MHz.
The 600us came from timing a transmit with vmalloc'ed buffer. The time 
between the last byte in the 20th SG entry and the next byte is 600us 
measured with a scope. The assumption is that handling interrupt and 
reloading PaRAM's is more or less the same on Tx and Rx side. This time 
seems to be confirmed by the number of bytes lost on the Rx side as well 
which is approximately 50 x XMHz.
Hope this clarifies..
Another solution to this would be to have the dummy Tx buffer and Rx 
buffer to be identical (same type of allocation, same length, same 
offset), but this requires changes in the SPI framework.

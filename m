First address range (configuration port: 0x4b300000) corresponds to QSPI
registers space. These registers alone are sufficient for generic SPI
communication (serial flash as well as non-flash SPI devices).

In order to speed up SPI flash reads SFI_MM_IF(SPI memory mapped
interface) is provided by QSPI IP. This _cannot_ be used with non-flash
devices.
The second address range (0x5c000000) corresponds to memory-mapped
region of SFI_MM_IF, through which SPI flash memories can be read as if
though they were RAM addresses (i.e using readl/memcpy). The SFI_MM_IF
block that takes care of communicating over SPI bus and getting the data
from flash device.
But SFI_MM_IF block needs to know some flash specific information(such
as read opcode, address bytes, dummy bytes, mode). This information must
first be populated in QSPI_SPI_SETUP*_REG(0x4B300054-60) before
accessing SFI_MM_IF address range via readl.
Both addresses space belong to same instance of the driver, one
corresponds to register space and other is memory-mapped region.
Therefore both regions are claimed by the same driver.

Not actually two instances.

Not shared clock.
The CTRL_CORE_CONTROL_IO_2[10:8] QSPI_MEMMAPPED_CS bit fields provides a
functionality for remapping the previously described address space which
starts at 0x5C000000 L3_MAIN address to one of the four supported chip
selects.
How about using syscon to access CTRL_CORE_CONTROL_IO_2?

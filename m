In non-dt case, the platform code supplying the gpio number (slave
select line) is responsible for requesting the gpio during the
machine_init call. So the gpio request is not called in the driver for
that gpio. In dt case, the 6th patch adds dt support and that patch
includes a gpio request call. Hence, this looks okay to me. Please
suggest if you still feel that there are changes required.

Thanks for reviewing the patches.

Thomas.

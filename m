No, I missed the call to cpufreq_frequency_table_target() in
__cpufreq_driver_target() which finds the exact frequency from cpufreq table
(which was created using opp table) and so we never screw up here. Sorry for
confusing everyone on this :(

This won't happen for CPUs because of the reason I explained earlier. cpufreq
core does the rounding before calling dev_pm_opp_set_rate(). And no other
devices use dev_pm_opp_set_rate() right now apart from CPUs, so we are not going
to break anything.

Hmm, so this patch won't break anything and I am inclined to apply it again :)

Does anyone see any other issues with it, which I might be missing ?

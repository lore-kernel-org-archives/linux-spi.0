Ah I see. I definitely missed this section.

It's definitely hard to tell this at a glance, nor does it really
matter.

I don't think there's any magic, and yes I do buy the argument that it
could be done normally.
Quite frankly, I don't know why the device works like this other than
pin saving. Probably some customer asked for it rather than there being
a generic use case.

No, I think the use case bit is important. The representation (in dt)
shouldn't change because someone wants to use the device as one big dac
or 4 smaller dacs. The multicast thing does certainly lend a lot of
weight to treating the dacs as one device, so I guess that would be the
designated representation for this dac.
But then I don't see why the microchip devices couldn't be dealt with in
the same way, even if they don't have multicast, in order to create a
single consistent way of describing the devices.

One of the arguments in the other part of the discussion was about "what
if regulators aren't shared", but I don't think that's a big deal? It's
easy to just add additional "vcc1-supply" (or whatever name) regulators
to the node.

And hopefully we can be blissfully ignorant and nobody actually mixes
and matches devices in this way anyway so we never have to deal with
it.

Hello,

this is the 2nd version of this series whose goal is to make struct
of_device_id.data const. Conceptually a driver must not modify the data
contained there so making it const is the right thing.

v1 of this series was sent with Message-id:
1342182734-321-1-git-send-email-y. Changes since then are:
 - powerpc fixes
 - several new consts that were found by Arnd that are possible after
   patch 19.
  =20
Arnd suggested to take this series via arm-soc late for 3.6 in one go
because patch 19 depends on the former patches but is a precondition to
the latter and it fixes a few warnings. So getting it in via the
respective maintainer trees would need a much bigger coordination
effort. That means I prefer getting Acks over you taking the patch.

Vinod Koul already took
        dmaengine: at_hdmac: add a few const qualifiers
that is in next-20120723 as 7fd63ccdad72 now. Vinod, I don't follow you=
r
pull requests, but assuming you didn't let it already pull for 3.6 I
suggest you drop it from your queue and I just take your Ack.

This series was build tested for arm (all defconfigs) and powerpc (all
defconfigs and an allyesconfig) and grep didn't find more issues. As
before it introduces a warning in drivers/regulator/twl-regulator.c.
This driver does modify its .of_match_table when a device is bound whic=
h
doesn't fits the concept of independant devices. Arnd noticed another
new warning in drivers/scsi/qlogicpti.c that isn't that easy to resolve=
,
because the pointer to (now) const data is passed as first argument to
scsi_host_alloc. To fix that properly struct Scsi_Host.hostt needs to
get a const, too. Alternatively I could introduce a cast removing the
const, but I don't like that.

This series is also available at:

	git://git.pengutronix.de/git/ukl/linux.git ofdeviceiddata

and I will modify it there for the Acks I'm getting.

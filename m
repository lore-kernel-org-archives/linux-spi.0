The flash chip can transfer data as long as you keep the clock going,
especially when you transfer 64k off a 4M flash.

The read command is bound just by stopping the clock. There is always
more data to be had.

There is no way to add timeout in the DMA driver since it does not
know the SPI clock.

The timeout is handled by the SPI driver and it should be possible to
augment it to drain the FIFO when DMA fails so long as FIFO level is
readable somewhere.

Yes, it looks like it.

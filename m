Ok, I will introduced a flag along the lines of cur_msg_mapped currently
part of spi_message struct.

This reminds me the issue of possible kmap'd buffers(falling in
PKMAP_BASE - PAGE_OFFSET-1  region) that might be passed to
spi_map_buf() which are not currently being handled properly. Boris
attempted to fix this in generic way[1] but was rejected as it couldn't
handle all type of caches.
I was wondering whether you would accept a patch returning error when
kmap'd buffers are passed to spi_map_buf()? Or would it still make sense
to port changes from that series to handle kmap'd buffers to SPI core alone?

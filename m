I agree.  Trying to make the transfer continuous is not solid and
does complicate the code.  Drop it.

Good point.  Any driver that requests SPI_CS_HIGH will be "broken" by using
the SFRMOUT signal for the chip select.  I think the Sim.One board test
have just been lucky with the mmc/sc-cards.  There are probably many cards
that will not work correctly on that platform.

I think we can live with the GPIOs for chip selects.

I think this helps regardless.  I makes sure the hardware is actually
doing something when a transfer starts instead of waiting for the first
interrupt to get things going.

Moving the interrupt clear into the unlikely() path probably makes sense.
It keeps the code from having to do the unnecessary memory write every time.

Also, is the IRQ_NONE check before that really necessary?  The IRQ_EP93XX_SSP
is not a chained interrupt so if ep93xx_spi_interrupt gets called I would
assume the interrupt must be valid.

Sounds good.

Once you post the v5 version I will test it then send you a patch for allowing
non-built-in GPIOs to be used for chip selects.

Hartley

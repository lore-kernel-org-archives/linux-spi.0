Yes, that is the intention. As I mentioned in the commit the long term
plan is to do the loading at the FW level (before the OS boots) using
the same mechanisms. But since this is going to take some time, I
think its worth having the option to do the loading from software for
two reason:

a) to provide a way for using this mechanism on older boards that will
not have the option to do a firmware update to get this functionality

b) to implement the software support needed in advance and have a way to test it

In this version of the patch the kernel is tainted. However, note that
in future versions I intend to remove it because it was already
removed part of the initrd ACPI table upgrade patch [1].

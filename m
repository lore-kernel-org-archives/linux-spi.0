I understand your concerns, but I'm not sure how to satisfy them without
crippling the design's ability to accomodate my use-case. I can't pass a
GPIO line per spi_board_info since in my case of a multiplexed CS
configuration a single pin's state does not uniquely determine the
desired CS. The only other option I can think of is that we somehow
provide a list of GPIOs for each bus and map the CS numbers to
permutations of GPIO states. Unfortunately, I don't know of any suitable
structure to put this GPIO list in. Perhaps I'm missing something obvious?

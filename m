Hi Mark,

I'm very sorry for delayed replay.

I think we have some misunderstanding here :(
1) All new properties a optional and should be specified for SPI Slave devices
2) Seems we are talking using different terms:
- you referring to the term "transfers" - sequence of packets.
  Each packet is one transfer (array of words).
- while these new properties affect on "transmissions" - sequence of words.
  Each word is one transmission.

Below is timing diagram which shows, in general, how these new parameters affect
on words transmission over Keystone/Davinci SPI bus:

        WDELAY - Delay in between transmissions
	C2TDELAY - Chip-select-active-to-transmit-start-delay
	T2CDELAY - Transmit-end-to-chip-select-inactive-delay


Also, below is additional information about properties which
are used in 5-pin mode (SPI_READY) to improve error detection
[OMAP-L138/da830 - http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spruh77a/spruh77a.pdf]:

>- ti,davinci-spi-t2e-delay: t2e delay

Transmit-data-finished-to-SPIx_ENA-pin-inactive-time-out.
T2EDELAY is used in master mode only. It defines a time-out value
as a multiple of SPI clock before the SPIx_ENA signal has to become
inactive and after the CS becomes inactive. The SPI clock depends
on which data format is selected. If the slave device is missing
one or more clock edges, it is becoming desynchronized. Although
the master has finished the data transfer the slave is still
waiting for the missed clock pulses and the SPIx_ENA signal is
not disabled. The T2EDELAY defines a time-out value that triggers
the DESYNC flag, if the SPIx_ENA signal is not deactivated in time.
The DESYNC flag is set to indicate that the slave device did not
deassert its SPIx_ENA pin in time to acknowledge that it has
received all the bits of the sent character. The DESYNC flag is
also set if the SPI detects a deassertion of the SPIx_ENA pin even
before the end of the transmission.

>- ti,davinci-spi-c2e-delay: c2e delay

Chip-select-active-to-SPIx_ENA-signal-active-time-out. C2EDELAY
is used only in master mode and it applies only if the addressed
slave generates an SPIx_ENA signal as a hardware handshake response.
C2EDELAY defines the maximum time between the SPI activates the chip
select signal and the addressed slave has to respond by activating
the SPIx_ENA signal.

Could you clarify, pls - Do you mean that struct spi_device.mode and 
common SPI DT bindings should be extended to support this?

Ok. It can be dropped from DT

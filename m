I think we are talking about different things, I agree the 'select
DMADEVICES' can be dropped but lets please keep the default y option
(not adding new select statements, just saying that if someone select
DMADEVICES in menuconfig and if they're ARCH_OMAP=1 , then default to
EDMA). This will simply allow people to have a default. Thanks.

Thanks

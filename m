I will have a look at kerneldoc and do the change. I'm waiting for a
minor number in "Low-density serial ports" before resending the
modifications asked by Andrew and Alan, so I will do this too. I just
trusted M-q in emacs for the comment layout.

I (wrongly!) was assuming that probing of devices is serialized. I
will add the lock.

it's freezeabe and (looking at include/linux/workqueue.) it implies
that it's single-threaded. This is important because I don't do
locking since I presume all the I/O to the MAX3100 is done in just one
workqueue. When I do I/O in other places (suspend for example) I
assume that the worqueue is friezed so not running.

Best regards and thanks for the review,

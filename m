ok, let me explain the reason for this function. The move from
worqueues to the threaded interrupts was motivated by a reduction of
latency in answering to RX buffer full interrupts. Threaded interrupts
are SCHED_FIFO instead worqueues being SCHED_OTHER. In the case of
MAX31x0 when we transmit a character we could have to receive one
(this is efficient because SPI transfers are quite always
bidirectional). The same routine is used both for tx and rx (an other
things like changing parameters): this makes locking really simple.
With this routine the thread interrupt handler could be the only kind
of deferred work a driver for a simple hardware may ever need.

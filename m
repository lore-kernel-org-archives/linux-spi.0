OK, I've been reading the code again, and unless I'm mistaken it's
utter nonsense.

The spi master device has a "bus lock flag" that's used in lieu of a
recursive mutex, but it seems to be used entirely incorrectly. The
logic I'm seeing in spi.c is essentially:

	if (some_task_has_spi_bus_locked)
		use_spi_master_without_locking();

There seems to be no check that the task that's using the master
without locking is the same one that locked it!

The relevant code in spi.c is in __pump_messages, where locking is

	if (!bus_locked)
		mutex_lock(&master->bus_lock_mutex);

bus_locked was provided by the caller from master->bus_lock_flag.

Also, master->bus_lock_flag is modified completely unsynchonized from
read access to master->bus_lock_flag. There is no locking of
master->bus_lock_mutex or master->bus_lock_spinlock around the read
accesses to master->bus_lock_flag, and in one place the write (of 0)
to master->bus_lock_flag takes place without holding the spinlock.

The obvious fix would be using an actual recursive mutex to obtain
recursive mutex semantics.

I've Cc'd everybody who appears to have been involved in the original
addition of the spi bus lock infrastructure and subsequent changes to
it.

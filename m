Agreed. I don't think anyone thinks this looks great, but I'll argue
that it's improving OPP for devices that already use it so that we can
remove voltage requirements when their clk is off. Think about CPUs that
are in their own clk domain where we want to remove the voltage
requirement when those CPUs are offline, or a GPU that wants to remove
its voltage requirement when it turns off clks. The combination is
already out there, just OPP hasn't solved this problem.

The only other plan I had was to implement another API like
dev_pm_set_state() or something like that and have that do something
like what the OPP rate API does right now. The main difference being
that the argument to the function would be some opaque u64 that's
converted by the bus/class/genpd attached to the device into whatever
frequency/voltage/performance state is desired (and sequenced in the
right order too). And then I was thinking that runtime PM or explicit
dev_pm_set_state() calls would be used to tell this new layer that the
device was going to a lower power mode with some other number (sub-kHz
integer?) and have that be translated again into some
frequency/voltage/performance state.

Either way, each driver will have to change from using the clk APIs to
changes rates to something else like one of these APIs, so I don't see a
huge difference. Drivers will have to change.

Yes, that's the plan. Problems come along with this though, like shared
resource constraints and actually knowing the clk on/off state,
frequency, voltage, etc. at boot time and making sure to keep those
constraints satisfied during normal operation.

It works when those drivers aren't calling clk_disable() directly from
some irq handler. I don't think that's very common, but in those cases
we would probably want to allow drivers to quickly gate and ungate their
clks but then defer the sleeping stuff (voltages and off chip clks) to
the schedulable contexts. We'll still be left with a small number of
drivers that want to only call clk_prepare() and clk_unprepare() from
within OPP and keep calling clk_enable() and clk_disable() from their
driver. So introduce different APIs for those drivers to indicate this
to OPP? And only do that when it becomes a requirement?

Otherwise I don't really see a problem with the OPP call handling the
enable state of the clk as well.

Any comments on these topics?

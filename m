Not entirely sure what you want to have confirmed here. There are multiple
masters and slaves on the HMATRIX internal bus on AVR32, and the DMA
controller supports up to three simultaneous configurations.

Sounds good to support configuration of more than one bus. I thought we
always did support that? Perhaps it was a non-standard avr32 implementation.

For the avr32 related stuff:

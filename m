Can you try doing JUST DMA, no PIO ? I remember seeing some bus synchronisation
issues when I did mixed PIO/DMA on the MXS and it was nasty to track down. Just
give pure DMA a go to see if the thing stabilizes somehow.

That might be doable, though you might want to try the above thing first.

You should run into issues as soon as the SPI NOR framework tries to read
status register, no ?

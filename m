The reason I gave the example use case is want to point out that
with Geert's patch set, a SPI device (with only one controller) can no 
longer
act as master and slave at the same time. because IMO as a SPI core 
function,
it needs to cover all the use cases, and to be as generic as possible.

BUT if you think the use case don't need to be supported from SPI core,
then I don't have objection either, I will only submit imx SPI slave 
support patch,
after your SPI slave support patch set been applied


Thanks,
Jiada

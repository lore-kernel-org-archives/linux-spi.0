This commit introduced the bug:

commit 1a77b127ae147f5827043a9896d7f4cb248b402e
Author: Shubhrajyoti D <shubhrajyoti@ti.com>
Date:   Sat Mar 17 12:44:01 2012 +0530

    OMAP : SPI : use devm_* functions

    The various devm_* functions allocate memory that is released when a driver
    detaches. This patch uses devm_request_and_ioremap
    to request memory in probe function. Since the freeing is not
    needed the calls are deleted from remove function.Also use
    use devm_kzalloc for the cs memory allocation.

and sure enough, reverting this makes the warning go away.

Specifically, it is this part which is the culpret:

because, at the time when omap2_mcspi_setup() is called, spi->dev is
not bound, and so is outside of the devres valid lifetime of that
struct device.

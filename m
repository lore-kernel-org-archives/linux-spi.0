It ignores the SS getting back up, confirmed by FSL. Sad :-(

When it comes to slave mode, you can not trust anything you don't research 
yourself, sorry :-(

You have a fixed-size MTU for those. But you can do gigabytes-long continuous 
transfer on generic SPI slave.

That can be handled with the DMA ... more or less. The problem really is that 
you generally can't anticipate the length of transfer.

Note that UART will either start dropping characters if it's buffers blow or 
something, ethernet will start dropping packets.

You're welcome to try this, many people did before and failed :(

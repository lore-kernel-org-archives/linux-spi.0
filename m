Glad to see that people are starting to convert their SPI NOR
controller drivers to the SPI mem approach.

I'd like a solution where we remove the old driver. I definitely don't
want to have both in parallel. Did you test the new driver with a SPI
NOR to check if it still works correctly? If you did, then I'd suggest
that you add a patch updating defconfigs where the SPI_ATMEL_QUADSPI is
selected and another patch removing the old driver.

This should be a simple mv from
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mtd/atmel-quadspi.txt to
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-atmel-qspi.txt

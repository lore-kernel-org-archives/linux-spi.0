Yes its an loopback test based on SPI interface available from
development board expansion connector.

MISO <---> MOSI [Loopback test]

So basically looking into the Board schematics we decide
which SPI interface is available on the board expansion connector
and use SPI interface available.

On zoom boards SPI3 was available on expansion connector
and same was used. On 4430SDP SPI2 interface was used.
On 2430SDP SPI2.

Also for testing, spi_board_info was populated in board file
and spi_register_board_info was done, here bus info was populated
based on spi bus available on the board. In spi_board_info structure
we initialize spi_bus and name as spitst and speed and chip-select
later once test module is loaded word-length, speed etc is modified
from proc interface available from the test module and data test
is done.

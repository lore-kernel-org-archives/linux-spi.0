Hi Huang,

Sorry to address this series so late.

I have a few questions about how you determine support for these DDR
modes.

To Mark / linux-spi:

Are DDR modes in the scope of drivers/spi/ at all, so that we could
someday wire it up through m25p80.c? Or is 'DDR' such a distortion of
the meaning of 'SPI' such that it will be restricted only to SPI NOR
dedicated controllers?

Why? That seems wrong. You need to know for sure how many cycles should
be used, not just guess a default.

Why does the dummy value belong in device tree? I think this can be
handled in software. You might, however, want a few other hardware
description parameters in device tree to help you.

So I think spi-nor.c needs to know a few things:

 1. Does the hardware/driver support DDR clocking?
 2. What granularity of dummy cycles are supported? So m25p80.c needs to
    communicate that it only supports dummy cycles of multiples of 8,
    and fsl-quadspi supports single clock cycles.

And spi-nor.c should be able to do the following:

 3. Set how many dummy cycles should be used.
 4. Write to the configuration register, to choose a Latency Code
    according to what the flash supports. I see modes that support 3, 6,
    7, or 8. We'd probably just go for the fastest mode, which requires
    8, right?

So far, none of this seems to require a DT binding, unless there's
something I'm missing about your fsl-quadspi controller.

Hmm, I think I should probably take another look at the design of
spi-nor.c... Why does spi_nor_scan() take a single 'mode' argument? The
driver should be communicating which (multiple) modes it supports, not
selecting a single mode. spi-nor.c is the only one which knows what the
*flash* supports, so it should be combining knowledge from the
controller driver with its own knowledge of the flash.

A ramification of my comment above is that we should not be returning an
error in a situation like this; we should be able to fall back to
another known-supported mode, like SDR QUAD, SDR DUAL, or just plain
SPI -- if they're supported by the driver -- and spi-nor.c doesn't
currently have enough information to do this.

So, I'll have to take another hard look at spi-nor.c soon. I think we
may need to work on the abstractions here a bit more before I merge any
new features like this.

Brian

P.S. Is there a good reason we've defined a whole read_xfer/write_xfer
API that is completely unused?

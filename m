Please don't top post, reply in line with needed context.  This allows
readers to readily follow the flow of conversation and understand what
you are talking about and also helps ensure that everything in the
discussion is being addressed.

A MFD?

That's obviously at best going to be fragile, you're implementing half
the operation here and half somewhere else which is most likely going to
break at some point when the framework changes.

It seems obvious from the code that this isn't actually interacting with
a SPI controller, you're writing an address and a value to a register
map rather than dealing with a byte stream.  There may be a SPI bus
somewhere behind some other hardware but you don't seem to be
interacting with it as such.

A register map would work just as well here, we already have plenty of
devices that abstract at this level (most obviously the I2C/SPI devices
that use it to offer both interfaces with a single core driver).

That's pretty poor, oh well.

btw. is it necessary to define new flags or is it possible to reuse some?

What about the law of readability of code ? ;-)

Good, but you clearly didn't test it in the most used case. This will clearly 
piss off a lot of people if you break something. And this will clearly not be 
good ;-)

I'm clearly planning to test the code, but only once it's clearly possible to 
tell apart churn from the actual fix (see my other rambling, just reminding 
you). So I'll wait for V2 and give it a go on a large flash.

Sorry, it is not obvious.

When using a flash, the DMA and PIO mode usage is intermixed. Usually, the PIO 
is used to program the command and then DMA to transmit the payload. It's hardly 
ever PIO only orr DMA only for the whole transfer.

btw. are you using MX23 or MX28 to test this?

You can always flip it the other way -- first rework the use of flags, then 
apply the fix. It'd make the patch much easier to understand, don't you think?

Splitting the patchset to make it more understandable is OK though. And I'm 
really getting lost in this patch.

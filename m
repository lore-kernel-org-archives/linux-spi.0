IMHO, the DDR modes can _NOT_ be handled by the driver/spi/*.
The SPI can only handles the byte streams. But the DDR mode may need to
handle the cycles(such as the dummy cycles could be 7 cycles) which is not byte.

So the DDR mode is handled by the SPI NOR controller now.

Please correct me if I am wrong. :)

Do you mean that if people do not set the DT node for dummy, we should
return an -EINVAL immediately?

I think you can send patches for these features. I does not clear about:
  for what does the spi-nor needs to know the above things.

where can we get the number of the cycles?

not right.

The DDR mode can not work if we set a wrong dummy cycles for the flash.

for some chips, the fastest mode may need 6 cycles, not 8.

It is okay for me to add multiples modes for the spi_nor_scan().
I added the single mode for spi_nor_scan is because that the fsl-quadspi
does not want to support the low speed modes. (Of course, the fsl-quadspi
controller does support the low speed modes.)

okay.  no problem.

These hooks are designed for other SPI NOR drivers, the fsl-quadspi does
not use them.

I think we also need to consider cross SoC drivers. One SoC may have
both clocks and OPPs to manage, while another may have only clocks.

Even it this may be fairly uncommon, we should consider it, before we
decide to fold in additional clock management, like
clk_prepare|unprepare() for example, behind the dev_pm_opp_set_rate()
API.

The point is, the driver may need to call clk_prepare|enable()
anyways, unless we make that conditional depending on a DT compatible
string, for example. Of course, because the clock prepare/enable is
reference counted, there may not be a problem in practice to have both
the OPP and driver to deal with it.

This seems like a reasonable approach to me.

At least it seams silly to invent a separate API and I can't think of
anything else that makes sense.

Is the about the multiple PM domains per device? I thought we have
already covered this case, or at least part of it [1].

Doesn't dev_pm_opp_set_genpd_virt_dev() and friends, help you with this, no?

Good question. What kind of problems do you see.

Will drivers fail to probe? Will the HW operate outside valid conditions?

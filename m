It's a bit more complicated than that. You may have operations running
in background that are using those big vmalloc-ed buffers at runtime.
To optimize things, we really need to split LEB/PEB buffers into
multiple ->max_write_size (or ->min_io_size) kmalloc-ed buffers.

Hm, the buffer itself is bigger than 11 bytes, it's just that the
same buffer is used in different use cases, and sometime we're only
partially filling it.

In case you clone most of the code from m25p80.c, you need to keep the
copyright of that file as well, and add yours on top of it.

The sign-off shouldn't be added by anyone than the person himself.  The
sign-off tag is generally used in the following cases as far as I know.

1. When the patch is authored, the author A should surely add his
   sign-off in the first place.

2. If person B submits A's patch with some or without any change on the
   patch, B should add his sign-off.

3. Maintainer C should add his sign-off when he applies the patch.

In any case, one's sign-off shouldn't be added anyone but himself.
I do not see the need to add sign-off of m25p80 authors at the current
situation.

Are you talking about drivers/mtd/devices/m25p80.c?  If so, I'm seeing
the following lines in the file.

MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
MODULE_AUTHOR("Mike Lavender");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("MTD SPI driver for ST M25Pxx flash chips");

I think we should keep the original MODULE_LICENSE and MODULE_AUTHOR,
add a new MODULE_AUTHOR("Huang Shijie <b32955-KZfg59tc24xl57MIdRCFDg@public.gmane.org>") line,
and update MODULE_DESCRIPTION line properly.

If this is from original m25p80.c, we shouldn't change it, IMO.

Are you sure about that?  Run git grep "redhat" on folder kernel\ and
see what you get.

What's the problem of that?  People are paid to do generic work, and why
shouldn't their employer's name be mentioned to give the credit.  As
long as the copyright is GPL, the code can be used, modified and
distributed freely, and I do not see any problem with having company
name in there.

Whether or not it is a big driver change, the binding should represent
what the hardware is capable of.

Did I miss something about the ADI devices in this thread where they
have some multicast ability to read all devices at once? I thought that
that was a different series where each device had dedicated mosi and
miso lines, rather than the shared ones here. I didn't think the ad5529r
did anything special from my reading of the datasheet but I'm not the
expert in this area!

I don't buy this argument, I just don't see what differs between the
devices. The microchip datasheet I read talked about using 3 devices to
measure 3 phase power setups (I think that's what it was) which is, in
my book, evidence that they're not just intended to be used
independently.

That said, the more this discussion goes on, the more I think that
merging the devices into a single node is a mistake. Logically there may
be one device, but really there are one to four devices. Doing the
logical device thing is nice maybe for software but I no longer think
that it represents the hardware correctly. I know this will cause
problems with registration of devices in the SPI core, but we need to
pick one representation for these devices that fits in all usecases
and with the things brought up in the other mail I am having a lot of
doubts.

Only going to reply to this for now, I'll reply to the other thread of
this conversation later so as not to end up duplicating discussion, but
I am thinking of things like what if someone puts a mcp3654r and an
ad5529r on the same chip select? I think that's actually perfectly
functional on a hardware level, provided the fuses/pins are set up
correctly (and if it is not, mixing the microchip devices is possible
and probably mixing future ADI ones will be too).

Cheers,
Conor.

Hi,

looking at your driver, there are several points that make me doubt tha=
t
it is working at all:

* The MAX3110 requires CS going low at the start of each 16-bit
transfer, if you look at the datasheet.=20

* in max3110_read_multi, it looks to me that this will work for
big-endian architectures only.

* I can't see how send_circ_buf() should work at all. You are just
sending a burst of characters to the MAX3110 without checking the
transmit buffer status at all. The MAX3110 has a single TX buffer only,
so that will cause transmit characters to be lost.

I think there's no need for a MAX3100 **and** a MAX3110 driver, this is
just confusing. The MAX3110 driver is identical to the MAX3100 from the
software view, it is simply a MAX3100 with transceivers added to the
chip. If there's any improvement, that should be merged into the
existing MAX3100 driver.

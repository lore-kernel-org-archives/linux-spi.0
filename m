There's nothing "broken" about $subject series. Please don't confuse maintainers
by using wrong words like that. This series is perfectly OK as such to be merged.

Further, I am puzzled by all this noise because card-detect additions were
initially agreed to be posted separately by you along with other custom DTS for
BBW MMC. Its obvious I wouldn't squash patches that we _agreed_ you would send
out- and that are especially additions than any real fixes. Hopefully this makes
it clear, if you need any help please let me know.

Thanks!

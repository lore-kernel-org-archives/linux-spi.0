Well, for the most part it looks like it should still work, but there
could be a gotcha, but first, let's get rid of a myth there.

The QSPI is _not_ specific to the M25P80.  The manual says nothing
about being specific to that device.  What it says is that it's for
SPI NOR memory.  It will work with bus widths of 1, 2 or 4 data lines,
so it probably works with non-M25P80 SPI NOR devices too - and the fact
that the read and write commands are completely programmable suggests
that using it with SPI NOR devices which do not use the M25P80 read
command value is intended.


The SFI is a state machine based translator which sits behind the SPI
interface (look at the manual).  It sequence sthe SPI bus through a
series of standard SPI states which happen to be the states I detailed
above.

Now, the first byte of the SFI-generated SPI message can be programmed
to any 8 bit value.  So the first byte of the SPI message is totally
under software control.  The next one to four bytes which comprise the
"address" can be controlled to by deciding where in the memory map to
start reading from.  Hence, the value of those bytes is also totally
under software control.  The number of dummy bytes can be programmed
too.  So far so good.

So, if we know that we have a SPI message which says "send 0x01 0x20
0x30, send one dummy byte, read 32 bytes", if we program the SFI to
send a read command as 0x01, program an address length of 2 bytes
with one dummy byte, and then read the next 32 bytes at the appropriate
offset in the memory mapping to cause the next two bytes to be 0x20,
0x30, then what we end up with on the bus is:

	send 0x01, 0x20, 0x30
	send one dummy byte

That much is good, but now is the problem - how does the SFI know that
we're going to require to read 32 bytes?  I think the answer to that
is that it doesn't know, so it probably just reads the number of bytes
which the access on the SoC bus is asking for, which makes it
indeterminant from a software point of view to control how many bytes
will be read without provoking another "send 0x01, next address, dummy
byte" sequence.

So, I'm now on the side of not parsing commands in the SPI driver, and
back on the idea that this needs to be handled in some other manner
which doesn't involve polluting the SPI core with flag-hacks.

Not only must the command be the same but also the response must be tha same.

The flash chip responds by sending arbitrary amount of data. Given
that transfer_one gets only the part that sends the read command and
the part to do the actual read may or may not follow this is getting a
bit hairy. Add in dummy bytes due to fast-read lag and page write
wrap-around and you get something that you definitely do not want
unless you are really sure that there is a flash memory on the other
end of the wire.

I won't consider "debugability" as a good reason to move interrupt
handlers into threads. There should be real workload that requires
offloading or specific prioritization.

Unfortunately, mask can change if SSCR1_TIE is cleared. So this is not
correct.

What would be an alternative to looping is masking (would be required
for threaded irq anyway - but then we won't need to loop in the first
place): disable all irq sources, check the status bits once, re-enable
according to a potentially updated set, leave the handler and let the
hardware call us again.

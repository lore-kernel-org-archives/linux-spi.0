Because you're not supposed to have a transfer larger than the FIFO,
but to have to setup at first a transfer the size of the FIFO, and
then when it's (or starts to be) depleted, fill it up again.

That's the point of the patch you're reverting, and if it doesn't
work, you should make it work and not simply revert it.

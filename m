No words in my last email suggested to use dynamic SPI clock speed,
I admited that method is brutal and not mature when my driver was
reviewed. In early version of our 3110 driver, we don't use dynamic
clock speed, but the maxim clock supports by 3110, while we still use=20
8 words buffer read for RX.

Let me cut my question clear: why not use the 8 words RX HW fifo? For
bulk RX in 230400 case, is 50us enough to handle controller IRQ +
spi subsystem overhead + tty receive overhead for one char per spi
transfer model?

Will consider that, thanks

Yes, the controller HW has a register to chose slave devices and thus
the HW CS handling is transparent to software. The controller supports =
several
slave devices connecting to it simultaneously, one is a 3G modem whose
throughput is about several Mega bits. The current in-tree controller d=
river
lacks DMA part, which is rejected as the related DMA controller driver =
never
show up publicly.

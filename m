But do you get an error then if the desired pins are not found?
If you do get an error, then sounds like it's OK to do.

Well I think we should consider at least the following:

1. Always see warnings when device tree is populated with board-generic.
   If somebody wants to use bootloader only muxing with DT, they can patch
   in pinctrl_provide_dummies() somewhere. But let's assume we always
   want to see the warnings with board-generic.c and DT.

2. For legacy booting without DT, we should not see any warnings
   from pinctrl-single.c as it's DT based.

3. There may be other non-pinctrl drivers too that are not DT
   based, and in those cases we should see the warnings as well
   for in the non-DT case.

Yeah I guess it's the case #1 above for board-generic.c.

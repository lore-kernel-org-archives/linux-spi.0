This patch doesn't make me feel very comfortable. It's quite big and I
think it contains multiple logical changes. It should be split up
further.

One logical change is: Merge the different FIFO watermark level
variables into a single variable since they are all the same.

Here you fix the order of the different step to start a transfer. This
could also be a separate patch, no?

This could also be a separate "Add missing dmaengine_terminate_all() for
rx dma" patch.

This is the most scary place in this patch and I think this should not
be resolved like that. The problem you are solving here is that you want
to transfer most of the data using DMA and only the remaining non
burstsize aligned data using PIO. Such a mixed DMA/PIO transfer doesn't
seem to be supported by the SPI core. To support it we must probably add
some possibility to call __spi_unmap_msg from the driver.

A much simpler approach to fix the issue would be to just forbid DMA
when the transfer size is not a multiple of the burstsize. Only bigger
transfers benefit from DMA, for the smaller ones DMA can even be slower.
I assume that the bigger transfers are burstsize aligned anyway, so it
might even not be necessary to have support for non burstsize aligned
DMA transfers.

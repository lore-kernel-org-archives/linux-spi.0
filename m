I think it's bad practice to add something to a binding that is not part
of the hardware definition for the device. In this case, the limitations
comes strictly from the DMAC. As I noted, the proper fix for this is to
have the DMA Engine API extended to allow querying the DMAC SG
capabilities before setting up a DMA transfer. I brought this up
previously in the thread where the actual EDMA dmaengine wrapper driver
was discussed and Vinod indicated that he was open to dmaengine
providing this information.

It makes sense as DMA Engine should tell the slave driver everything it
needs to know to set up a transfer...this is just a missing piece right
now. FWIW, we have this issue in davinci_mmc.c as well...it just was
already hardcoded with a value to satisfy the EDMA DMAC. However, I'd
like to see that go away as well.

You can tune the values of nor->mtd.size, nor->mtd.erasesize, nor->page_size
or whatever member of nor/nor.mtd as needed without ever modifying members of
*info.

If you modify *info then spi_nor_scan() is called a 2nd time to probe and
configure SPI memories of the same part but connected to another controller,
the values of the modified members in this *info would not be those expected.
So *info and the spi_nor_ids[] array must remain const.

The *info structure is not used outside spi_nor_scan(); none of spi_nor_read(),
spi_nor_write() and spi_nor_erase() refers to *info hence every relevant value
can be set only nor or nor->mtd members.


Anyway, I think OR'ing or AND'ing values of memory registers depending on
the relevant bit we want to check is not the right solution.
If done in spi-nor.c, there would be a specific case for each memory register
we read, each register bit would have to be handled differently.

spi-nor.c tries to support as much memory parts as possible, it deals with
many registers and bits: Status/Control registers, Quad Enable bits...

If we start to OR or AND each of these register values to support the stripping
mode, spi-nor will become really hard to maintain.

I don't know whether it could be done with the xilinx controller but I thought
about first configuring the two memories independently calling spi_nor_scan()
twice; one call for each memory.

Then the xilinx driver could register only one struct mtd_info, overriding
mtd->_read() [and likely mtd->_write() and mtd->_erase() too] set by
spi_nor_scan() with a xilinx driver custom implementation so this driver
supports its controller stripping mode as it wants.

Of course, this solution assumes that the SPI controller has one dedicated
chip-select line for each memory and not a single chip-select line shared by
both memories. The memories should be configured independently: you can't
assume multiple instances of the very same memory part always return the exact
same value when reading one of their register. Logical AND/OR is not a generic
solution, IMHO.

If the xilinx controller has only one shared chip-select line then let's see
whether 2 GPIO lines could be used as independent chip-select lines.

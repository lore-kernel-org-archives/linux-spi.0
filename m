I agree to some extent, but I wanted to confirm with the SPI guys that
DDR is truly unique to SPI NOR. (I know it doesn't currently support
it.)

Sure.

But that's the same story for some (but not all) of the dual and quad
modes now; some have dummy cycles that are not multiples of 8 bits.

Because there are some DDR modes which have 8 dummy cycles, it is
theoretically possible for the SPI subsystem to handle them.

Right.

BTW, does your quadspi controller unconditionally support DDR, or is
there any dependency on board/clock configuration? I'm just curious
whether you need a DT binding to describe DDR support, or if (as long as
the flash supports it, and we get the dummy cycles right) you can always
use DDR QUAD.

Possibly. But I actually don't think this belongs in DT at all. See

To properly abstract features between a driver and the spi-nor
"library." For example, we need to make sure we don't try to use a
command mode with 7 dummy cycles on m25p80.c; right now, each driver has
to (implicitly) know the details of dummy cycles when selecting a 'mode'
parameter for spi_nor_scan(). spi-nor.c should be selecting this for us,
not forcing the driver to make the selection.

This should be a property of the flash device, just like everything else
we detect in spi-nor.c.

OK, but can spi-nor.c detect this instead of putting this in DT? e.g.,
associate this with the device ID?

Or even better, we can support CFI detection for SPI NOR flash. I notice
the datasheet for your Spansion flash [1] has an extensive set of CFI
parameters defined, including the dummy cycle information. I think it
might be more sustainable to try to support CFI [2] and SFDP [3] for
detecting new flash, rather than adding new table entries ad-hoc.

Right, fsl-quadspi only supports one mode. But m25p80.c is more
flexible, and I think we might have broken some of it in the process
(e.g., if the SPI controller supports single/dual/quad but the flash
only supports single, then we might fail to probe).

I can take a look at this problem if you don't. I'd just recommend that
we might take a step back on a few of these issues before blazing ahead
with something irrevocable, like a DT binding.

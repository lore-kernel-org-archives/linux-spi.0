No, when booting with DT, the filter_fn and data are not used at all,
we get the dma channel by parsing the DT instead.

No, of_dma_filter_info/of_dma_simple_xlate was a mistake, we should never
have even introduced that. All drivers that rely on this can simply
provide their own xlate function that calls of_dma_get_slave_channel()
or one of the related functions.

edma is particularly trivial, it can just use of_dma_xlate_by_chan_id()
instead of of_dma_simple_xlate, as it looks up the channel by its number.
